His family told industry publication Variety that he died on Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, California. "His films were revolutionary and iconoclastic, and captured the spirit of an age," their statement said. Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro are among the actors he helped develop. Directors James Cameron and Martin Scorsese cut their teeth on his films. Many of his films became cult classics and he became famous for the speed at which he worked, often making two films at the same location and at the same time, in order to save money. Roger Corman was born in Detroit on 5 April 1926. His father, William, was an engineer and he had intended to follow in his footsteps. However, while studying at college, he became attracted to film-making and after a spell working for General Motors quit his job and went to work at 20th Century Fox as a messenger boy. Having failed to make much progress, he set off for Europe where among other things, he briefly studied English literature at Oxford. He returned to the US with ambitions to become a screenwriter. He sold his first script, The House in the Sea, in 1953 and it was filmed as Highway Dragnet the following year with Corman being credited as co-producer. However, he was so upset by the changes made to his story that he scraped together some cash and set himself up as a producer. Corman began directing in 1955 with Swamp Women and over the next 15 years he made more than 50 films, gaining a reputation for the speed with which he could turn them out. It became something of a joke in the film industry that Corman could negotiate a contract from a public phone, shoot the film in the phone box and pay for it with the coins in the change slot. The 1960 release, The Little Shop of Horrors, which featured a brief appearance by a young Jack Nicholson, took just two days to shoot with Corman using the set of a previous film, Bucket of Blood. A stage musical based on the film opened in 1982 and would itself spawn a second film version four years later. Corman decided to widen his horizons with a series of films based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe and featuring Vincent Price as the lead in all but one of them. The House of Usher was released in 1960 and was followed by a string of others including The Raven, The Masque of the Red Death and The Tomb of Ligeia. His 1962 film, The Intruder, which examined racial tensions in America\'s Deep South, featured a young William Shatner and won an award at the Venice Film Festival. Despite this, the film flopped at the box office and became Corman\'s first film to make a loss, prompting him to remark that he\'d stick to making films that entertained rather than carried a social message. For a time he became part of the 1960s counter-culture, making biker film The Wild Angels, which starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra. He also directed The Trip, which was written by and starred Jack Nicholson. The film was seen as the precursor of Easy Rider, with both Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper featuring in the cast In the late 60s he set up his own production company, New World Pictures. As well as continuing to make budget movies, he also began handling films made by distinguished foreign film-makers, including Francois Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini and introducing them to an American audience. He sold New World Pictures in the 1980s but went on to form two more production companies. He also returned to the director\'s chair in 1990 with the film Frankenstein Unbound. Based on a Brian Aldiss novel, it starred John Hurt and Bridget Fonda and featured a brief appearance by Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the Australian band INXS. In 2009 he received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement and continued to work well into his eighties, producing the 2010 films Dinoshark and Sharktopus for the Syfy TV channel. The sheer quantity of films on which he worked is almost without precedent, as was his ability to find and nurture new talent. Many of his films have taken on cult status and few directors have been so successful at making popular pictures on such tight budgets. When asked how Corman would like to be remembered, he said, \'I was a filmmaker, just that,\'" the family said in their statement.

Price, who becomes Walesâ\x80\x99 14th world champion, achieved the feat in just her seventh professional fight in front of a passionate Cardiff crowd at the Utilita Arena. The new WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine welterweight champion, Price could be set for some huge nights ahead in a stacked division with the likes of Natasha Jonas, Sandy Ryan and Mikaela Mayer all now potential future opponents. Price, a 2020 Olympic champion, won every round on the judges\' cards after the ringside medics decided 39-year old American McCaskill could not safely continue. â\x80\x9cThis has got to be up there with winning a gold medal,â\x80\x9d Price said. â\x80\x9cJessica McCaskill is a credit to the sport, but this was my night. â\x80\x9cI want to create a legacy and I honestly believe this is just the start. It took me a couple of rounds to find my rhythm, it was a tough fightâ\x80¦ but I enjoyed myself in there tonight. â\x80\x9cI am only going to get better. I am still learning.â\x80\x9d Price, also a former kickboxing world champion and international footballer, had made clear she felt she belonged on the biggest stage after being catapulted into the limelight in just her seventh paid fight. Fighting a mere 14 miles or so from her home town of Ystrad Mynach, Price was looking to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Joe Calzaghe, Enzo Maccarinelli and current world champion Joe Cordina who have all enjoyed winning nights in the Cardiff Arena. Cordina, who has twice won world titles in the Welsh capital, had implored Price to enjoy her moment being centre stage, warning that she might never again enjoy the chance to fight in front of her home fans. Price, who fought all over the world as an amateur, had never boxed professionally in Wales and the event, broadcast live on BBC Wales as the broadcaster showed a world title fight for the first time in 19 years, had a distinctly Welsh flavour. The 29-year old entered the ring to the Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd â\x80\x93 perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with more than 50 Wales football caps - with former Welsh world champions Maccarinelli, Lee Selby, Steve Robinson and Barry Jones all in attendance at ringside. Lauren Price became world champion in just her seventh professional fight This was unquestionably the biggest night of Priceâ\x80\x99s professional career but she showed no signs of nerves as she sensibly looked to create space and distance against a fighter renowned for ploughing forward on the front foot. A cagey first session saw Price land the slightly cleaner shots, keeping her composure as she landed with a flurry of punches at the end of round two. McCaskill is a fighter who never takes a backward step but Price worked behind her jab and used her speed and movement to tag the American with a series of eye-catching shots. The Detroit fighter was warned for holding and pushing in the third round and she struggled to deal with Priceâ\x80\x99s relentless pace, with the Welsh boxer looking far more experienced than her six pro fight resume. Price and McCaskill had an accidental clash of heads in the fifth round that left huge swelling around McCaskillâ\x80\x99s left eye as the home fighter began to take control. Price, who dedicated her win to her grandmother Linda and late grandfather Derek, who raised her, says she wants to create a legacy for Welsh womenâ\x80\x99s boxing and winning her first world title is the first step. A unique athlete who wrote in a school letter aged just eight that she wanted to be a world kickboxing champion, international footballer and Olympian, Price is used to chasing her dreams and has become a world champion just 23 months after making her professional debut. The Rob McCracken-trained fighter had vowed that she would not allow McCaskill to turn the contest into a â\x80\x9cdogfightâ\x80\x9d and was true to her word as she used her superior defensive acumen and speed to dominate from start to finish. McCaskillâ\x80\x99s corner were having to work overtime to deal with the swelling above her left eye, with the American flying out of her corner in the sixth session in search of the one big punch she felt could stop the fight in an instant. However, Price was too composed to deviate from the gameplan and she continued to land the more telling blows as she continually tagged the champion on the inside before dancing out of reach. The latter rounds became far more attritional for Price with McCaskill desperately swinging haymakers as she looked for the one punch that could change the course of the fight and ensure she kept her titles. The fight was halted after Jessica McCaskill\'s eye was assessed by the ringside medic for a second time However, the damage to McCaskillâ\x80\x99s eye was too great with the ringside medic deciding at the start of round nine that McCaskill was unable to continue. â\x80\x9cBoxing has a new superstar,â\x80\x9d Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom said.

On the undercard, featherweight Rhys Edwards underlined his credentials as his undefeated record continued with a unanimous and clear points victory over experienced opponent Thomas Patrick Ward. Edwards is now 16-0 and won the WBA intercontinental title as he produced an eye-catchingly impressive display in front of his home fans. Edwardsâ\x80\x99 stablemates Kyran Jones and Kane Shepherd were also victorious, with Jones beating fellow Welshman Lewis Howells on points while Shepherd beat Ismael Ellis whose corner retired their fighter after a one-sided contest including a knockdown.

The Motorsport Ireland driver was pipped to victory by Spain\'s Jan Solans by a margin of just 3.2 seconds. McErlean, 24, was faster than Solans in a final stage shootout but came up just short of victory. "An incredible experience," said TokSport Skoda driver McErlean. "We have our first WRC2 podium, and no finer man to have beside me than James Fulton [McErlean\'s co-driver]. "Thanks to TokSport and Skoda for a great car but most of all, thank you to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy for always believing in me." McErlean, who was making his first WRC start of the season for TokSport Skoda, had swapped the lead with Solans on several occasions throughout the rally. The 24-year-old led by 0.1 seconds with two stages remaining, but Solans hit back and was fastest by 6.5 seconds on the penultimate stage. McErlean posted the fastest time on the final run by 3.2 seconds, but fell short of a first win by the same margin. Solans and McErlean had capitalised on accidents from experienced leaders Oliver Solberg and Gus Greensmith earlier in the event but, in truth, the pair showed great speed throughout the rally and were deserving of podium finishes. McErlean\'s performance was enough to finish ninth overall in the rally, which was won by the Rally1 machine of Sebastien Ogier. There was misfortune for Northern Ireland\'s William Creighton and Kris Meeke, who both retired on Saturday. Junior WRC champion Creighton restarted to finish the rally in 12th place in WRC2. Josh McErlean\'s first WRC2 podium feels like it had been a long time coming. He has long been tipped to challenge at the front, but Rally Portugal was a coming-of-age performance when he kept a cool head and highlighted blistering pace, while many more experienced rivals faltered. The switch from Hyundai to Skoda has already paid off and he starts his WRC2 in style, and his confidence will only grow from here. A lot was made of Motorsport Ireland\'s failed bid to secure a round of the World Rally Championship, due to a failure to get government funding - something the Rally Northern Ireland bid knows all too well - but its academy drivers show the island of Ireland has a lot to offer the world stage after the passing of the late, great Craig Breen. McErlean\'s podium was also a poignant moment, as the 24-year-old had been mentored by Breen, who was also navigated by Fulton before his passing. Fellow academy driver William Creighton is making good progress in the WRC2 class after taking the Junior WRC title last year, and Motorsport Ireland-backed drivers Jon Armstrong and Aoife Raftery are also impressing in the European championship.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Esther Perez Ruiz, the Fund’s resident representative for Pakistan, said: “A mission team led by Nathan Porter, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan, will meet with authorities next week to discuss the next phase of engagement. “The aim is to lay the foundation for better governance and stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economic growth that will benefit all Pakistanis,” she added. Pakistan last month completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but the government has stressed the need for a fresh, longer-term programme. Last week, the Fund said that a mission was expected to visit Pakistan this month to “discuss the FY25 budget, policies, and reforms under a potential new programme for the welfare of all Pakistanis”. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the $350bn economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. On Friday, the Fund said that downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the IMF in its staff report following the second and final review under the standby agreement. The Fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements. Additional input from Reuters Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.

AJK witnessed violent clashes between the police and activists of a rights movement amid a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the territory on Friday and Saturday, which left at least one police official dead and more than 90 others injured, officials told Dawn.com on Saturday. Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali had said that Sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest in the town of Islamgarh, where he was deployed to stop a rally for Muzaffarabad under the banner of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC). The JAAC, which has traders at the forefront in most parts of the state, has been seeking the provision of electricity as per hydropower generation cost in AJK, subsidised wheat flour and an end to the privileges of the elite class. They called for the strike following the arrest of at least 70 of their members in raids on Thursday. Reports emerged in the wake of the protests on Sunday that three Rangers battalions had entered the territory through Kohala and were awaiting further orders. However, AJK Minister for Rural Development Faisal Mumtaz Rathore confirmed that the Rangers, due to the intervention of President Asif Zardari, were “called back as soon as they entered Azad Kashmir” since the situation had calmed down. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, former prime minister of AJK Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi slammed the deployment, calling it a “drama” and an attempt to score political points. “First they send them, then call them back, what is this?” the ex-AJK PM said. “Those fighting for their rights and engaging in protest are free to do so, but they must remain peaceful,” Niazi said in a press conference. He added that they (the protestors) must not give the “enemy” a chance to sow discord within the territory and create infighting. In a post on Facebook, Rathore acknowledged the public demands for cheap electricity, but admitted that addressing them was “out of his hands”. “The big demand of the people, the demand for cheap electricity and the end of loadshedding, falls under the jurisdiction of the Government of Pakistan,” Rathore said. Urging the public to remain peaceful, he said, “In this one year [I have been in office], I have never been against the right to peaceful protest and [never] supported violence against people.” In the aftermath of the protests, JAAC leader Shaukat Nawaz Mir reiterated that the committee is a peaceful organisation and willing to negotiate with the authorities to ensure the provision of cheap electricity and cheap flour. He also appreciated the withdrawal of the Rangers from the area. “We have planned another shutter-down strike,” he told reporters on Sunday. “We have been peaceful for the last year and always will be a peaceful movement. This territory and its institutions and police are our own.” Mir maintained that the JAAC is advocating for the rights of the public in AJK, “but it is the bureaucrats who do not understand the public’s needs that are doing the damage”. The JAAC is peaceful and open to negotiations, Mir added, requesting to be notified by the authorities about decisions taken. “We do not want to hurt anyone.” He also slammed the federal government for not cutting down spending while at the same time claiming they have no room in the budget to subsidise electricity or flour. “The government claims they can’t provide cheap electricity and flour because they have no budget, but they have the money for watches and cars,” Mir said, adding that the federal government and the prime minister should be “ashamed”. “I don’t want my forum to be controversial,” Mir said. “We are made up of respectable politicians … the local council is standing with us”. The JAAC leader added that the movement was successful since members of multiple parties and councils “are on our side”. “Our nation is conscious now. There is no politics here, we just want our rights and identity.” Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

As he met players of the men’s national team in the Irish capital of Dublin, the PCB quoted him as saying: “Fight till the last ball; the competition should be apparent.” On Friday, Ireland recorded their maiden T20 win against Pakistan who could not defend a solid-looking 182-5 after being put in to bat first, dealing a shocking blow to the Babar Azam-led side’s preparations for the World Cup, which is taking place next month in the United States. The loss to Ireland, who are in Pakistan’s group in the T20 World Cup, came after a series draw on home soil to a New Zealand squad missing most of their first-choice players. With Babar only recently reinstated as captain, it was another bump in the road for their tournament preparation. Today’s match will start at 7pm, with Ireland leading the series by 1-0. In a post on X, the PCB shared a video of Naqvi meeting the Green Shirts and speaking to them, adding that a detailed discussion on the action plan took place during the two-hour-long meetup. Encouraging the team, the PCB chairman urged the players to play with hard work, passion and a “professional approach”. He noted that T20 cricket needed a unique and aggressive approach, adding that victory was only possible if cricket was played in a “modern manner”. “An action plan can be formulated while sitting in a room but the real test is on the ground, where the performance should be visible,” the PCB quoted him as telling the team. Naqvi praised all players as “undoubtedly talented, professional and the best”, adding that the team’s bowling attack was “splendid”. However, he emphasised that great attention was required when fielding so that the opponent “cannot get any chance” to score. “The players are the hope for Pakistan and you have to meet the nation’s expectations. Teamwork is the fundamental thing for victory,” the PCB chairman said. He noted that the public loved cricket and had expectations from the team. Naqvi said that success would come if all 11 of the players in the team performed with unity. “No one is accepting the loss in the first match against Ireland. The real test after Ireland and England is the World Cup,” he added. Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said Israeli airstrikes pounded parts of northern, central and southern Gaza during the night and into Sunday morning. In Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city which sits on the Egyptian border, the Kuwaiti hospital said on Sunday it had received the bodies of “18 martyrs” killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported at least two fatalities, a father and son, both doctors, in a strike on Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Mourners react next to the body of a Palestinian killed in Israeli strikes at Al-Aqsa hospital, in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip on May 12. — Reuters A full-scale Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah “cannot take place”, the UN human rights chief insisted, saying it could not be reconciled with international law, AFP reports. “The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!” Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement. “These exhausted, famished people, many of whom have been displaced many times already, have no good options. He said a full-scale offensive could have a “catastrophic impact […] including the possibility of further atrocity crimes.” “I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.” Volker said he was deeply distressed by fast-deteriorating conditions in Gaza, saying the latest evacuation orders had triggered “massive displacement of an already profoundly traumatised population”. He said the towns supposed to receive those displaced from Rafah had already been “reduced to rubble”. Turk also voiced concern at reports of indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza.\nHe said a full-scale offensive on Rafah “cannot take place” and called on all states with influence to do everything in their power to prevent it. He also called on Israel and Palestinian armed groups to agree on a ceasefire, and for all hostages to be released immediately. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned Israel against expanding its military operations to Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “We consider an offensive on Rafah […] to be irresponsible,” Scholz said on a talk show organised by the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group in Potsdam just outside Berlin. “We warn against this, and we do not believe that there is any concept that will ultimately lead to this happening without incredible human losses in terms of innocent civilians,” he said. The German chancellor added that humanitarian aid must also be brought to Gaza, and there must be a perspective for peaceful coexistence in which two states can exist side by side. The health ministry in Gaza said that at least 35,034 people have been killed in the territory during more than seven months of Israeli bombardment, AFP reports. The toll includes at least 63 deaths over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,755 people have been wounded in the Gaza Strip since October 7. Months after Israel said it had dismantled Hamas’ command structure in northern Gaza — devastated by intense violence in the early stages of the offensive — fighting has resumed in recent days in Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City’s Zeitun neighbourhood. AFP correspondents reported intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters in the Zeitun area early on Sunday, with medics and witnesses saying troops were engaged in combat in Zeitun as well as Jabalia. A displaced Palestinian woman, who fled Jabalia after the Israeli military called on residents to evacuate, carries her belongings on her head as she makes her way towards Gaza City on May 12. — Reuters Britain’s foreign minister David Cameron has said Israel should not carry out an offensive in the Gazan city of Rafah without a “clear plan” to protect people, AFP reports. “For there to be a major offensive in Rafah, there would have to be an absolutely clear plan about how you save lives, how you move people out the way, how you make sure they’re fed, you make sure that they have medicine and shelter and everything,” he told Sky News television. “We have seen no such plan … so we don’t support an offensive in that way,” he added. Cameron said Israel needed to “do better” in allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. “I’ve said many times that I’m not content with the action Israel has taken over humanitarian aid,” he said, adding there are “some signs” of improvement, “but not fast enough”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged an immediate halt to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, the return of hostages and a “surge” in humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “I repeat my call, the world’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages and an immediate surge in humanitarian aid,” Guterres said in a video address to an international donors’ conference in Kuwait. “But a ceasefire will only be the start. It will be a long road back from the devastation and trauma of this war”, he added. “The war in Gaza is causing horrific human suffering, devastating lives, tearing families apart and rendering huge numbers of people homeless, hungry and traumatised,” Guterres said. His remarks were played at the opening of the conference in Kuwait organised by the International Islamic Charitable Organisation (IICO) and the UN’s humanitarian coordination organisation OCHA. In the course of the past 24 hours, there is clear pressure being exerted by the Israeli military on three fronts inside the Gaza Strip, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reports from Deir Al Balah. They have been maximising pressure on Rafah, the middle area as well as the north of the territory, he says, highlighting that the Israeli military has passed an evacuation order for residents of the Jabalia refugee camp and in the central areas of Rafah. The Israeli military has started to intensify the bombardment of the Jabalia camp in the past couple of hours, destroying residential houses and attacking evacuation centres, the report said. They say they are trying to completely eliminate Hamas battalions there despite a previous announcement that said they had managed to take military control in the north of this Strip, it added. Smoke billows during Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip from a position in southern Israel on May 12. — AFP Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram has asserted that the adoption of a resolution advocating Palestine’s full membership in the United Nations by a large majority would ramp up political pressure on the United States to reassess its position within the Security Council. The UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on Friday with 143 votes. The US and eight other countries voted against the resolution, while 25 abstained. Three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — China, France, and Russia — voted for the resolution. Britain abstained. Among US allies, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Spain, and Mexico voted for the resolution, while Germany and Canada abstained. All South Asian nations — Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan — voted in favour. Almost all Arab and other Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, also voted for the resolution. Read more here. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Imad Abu Zayda, an emergency doctor in Gaza’s Jabalia, said: “No light due to the lack of fuel and there’s no medical supplement available as Israel has expanded their operation in the area. We have no oxygen to give to patients. “Most of the injuries are children and women. We are operating with minimum facilities,” the doctor added. Israel has launched strikes on Gaza after it expanded an evacuation order for Rafah, with AFP correspondents reporting intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters near Gaza City. Witnesses said Israel had carried out strikes in Rafah near the crossing with Egypt on Saturday, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Residents piled water tanks, mattresses and other belongings onto vehicles and prepared to flee again. Residents were told to go to the “humanitarian zone” of Al-Mawasi, on the coast northwest of Rafah. “We don’t know where to go,” said Farid Abu Eida, who was preparing to leave Rafah, having already been displaced there from Gaza City. “There is no place left in Gaza that is safe or not overcrowded… There’s nowhere we can go.” Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said “we have eliminated dozens of terrorists in eastern Rafah” and the army claimed troops were fighting “armed terrorists” at the crossing and had found “numerous underground tunnel shafts”. Gaza’s civil defence agency has said that two doctors were killed in an Israeli air strike on the city of Deir Al Balah in a central area of the Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “The bodies of Doctor Muhammad Nimr Qazaat and his son, Doctor Youssef, were recovered (as they were killed) because of an Israeli raid on the city of Deir Al Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and they were transferred to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah,” the agency said in a statement. The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Music fans who gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday to watch the Eurovision contest decried juries’ snubs of Israel as “obviously political”, AFP reports. The mood was electric at the packed Layla bar in Tel Aviv as the show got underway, with the crowd going wild when Israel’s contestant Eden Golan appeared on screen. As votes started ticking in, and it became clear that few of the juries representing the 37 countries with voting rights were offering Golan even a handful of votes, spirits fell. Fans went from jumping around and waving Israeli flags to sitting downcast, some with their heads in their hands. “This is clearly political,” said Guy, a 20-year-old who declined to give his last name. “Eden was amazing… But there are people who hate us. They don’t see the whole picture,” he told AFP. “We didn’t get much from the countries. That’s obviously a political thing,” Layla manager Tal Shur agreed. Switzerland’s Nemo has won the Eurovision Song Contest, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel’s participation during the conflict in Gaza, AFP reports. Twenty-four-year-old Nemo’s “The Code” won the highest score from nations’ juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden’s Malmo. “I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world,” a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy. Nemo, Baby Lasagna and Israel’s contestant Eden Golan, had been bookmaker favourites to win the competition, watched around the world by millions of lovers of pop music — and kitschy shows. When Golan went on stage to perform her “Hurricane”, both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena. Boos could also be heard while Israel delivered its points to other acts and any time a country gave “Hurricane” high scores. Golan finished fifth with 375 points. This year’s winner Nemo, representing Switzerland, speaks during a press conference after the final of the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) at Malmö Arena, in Malmö, Sweden on May 12. — AFP Israel has hit parts of Gaza including Rafah where it expanded an evacuation order, as the UN warned an outright invasion of the crowded city risked an “epic” disaster, AFP reports. AFP journalists, medics and witnesses reported strikes across the coastal territory, where the UN says humanitarian relief is blocked after Israeli troops defied international opposition and entered eastern Rafah this week. That effectively shut a key aid crossing and suspended traffic through another. At least 21 people were killed during strikes in central Gaza and taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah city, a hospital statement said. Bodies covered in white dust lay on the ground in a courtyard of the facility. A man in a baseball cap leaned over one body bag, clasping a dust-covered hand that protruded. The feet of another corpse poked from under a blanket bearing the picture of a large teddy bear. In Rafah, witnesses reported intense air strikes near the crossing with Egypt, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Other strikes occurred in north Gaza, witnesses said. Hamas has accused Israel of “expanding the incursion into Rafah to include new areas in the centre and the west of the city”. A woman sits next to belongings, as Palestinians prepare to evacuate, after Israeli forces launched a ground and air operation in the eastern part of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on May 11. — Reuters Israel’s military has said that a new field hospital has been established in the central Gaza Strip and is being run by a non-governmental organisation, the International Medical Corp, Reuters reports. “The field hospital will be operated by 150 international medical aid workers and its dozens of beds can be used for emergency and routine medical treatment,” the military said in a statement. The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees has released images of heavily damaged or destroyed schools it runs in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where many Palestinians have been forcibly displaced after the Israeli invasion of Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “The classrooms are torched. Walls are blown out. There is rubble everywhere,” it said, adding there is no real safety or shelter at these schools. “This situation is unfolding under the world’s watch. Enough is enough.” Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the entry of aid into Gaza from the Rafah crossing due to Israel’s “unacceptable escalation”, Egypt’s state-affiliated Alqahera News satellite TV has reported, citing a senior official. Reuters reports the official also said that Egypt held Israel responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the Gaza Strip. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has discussed the dire situation in Gaza with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, with the officials agreeing that a full-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah would have catastrophic consequences and must be prevented, Al Jazeera reports quoting UN read-out. Guterres expressed “deep appreciation for Qatar’s continued mediation efforts to broker a deal for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza and the immediate release of hostages”, the statement added. The Israeli army has said rockets were launched from Rafah in southern Gaza towards the Kerem Shalom crossing, which was temporarily shut earlier this week after deadly fire, AFP reports. “Four launches were identified that crossed from the Rafah area”, the military said in a statement, adding that one rocket was intercepted by Israeli air defences “and the rest fell in open areas” around Kerem Shalom. It added that “no injuries were reported.” Weeks after attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration, Egyptian-American student Layla Sayed received a text message from a friend drawing her attention to a website dedicated to exposing people it says promote hatred of Jews and Israel. “I think they found you from the protest,” the friend wrote. When Sayed visited the site, called Canary Mission, she found a photo from the October 16 rally at the University of Pennsylvania with red arrows pointing to her among the demonstrators. The post included her name, the two cities she lives in, details about her studies and links to her social media accounts. Read more from Reuters here.

The health ministry in Gaza has said that at least 34,971 people have been killed in the Palestinian enclave during Israel’s military bombardment in Gaza, AFP reports. The tally includes at least 28 deaths in the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,641 people have been wounded since fighting broke out on October 7. Saheb al-Hams, a hospital director in Rafah, has said that “sadly” the Kuwaiti Specialty Hospital in Rafah city “is now included in the places threatened with evacuation” following Israel’s latest order, Al Jazeera reports. “There is no other place for patients and injured people to go to but this hospital,” al-Hams said in a video message to journalists. The director called for “immediate international protection” for the medical facility. Palestinian Ambassador to the UK Husam Zomlot expressed his appreciation for Harvard students renaming a building after one of his relatives.

Nijjar — who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 — had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged “terrorism” and conspiracy to commit murder — allegations he denied. He was shot dead on June 18, 2023, by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver. Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had “credible allegations” connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying. India dismissed the allegations as “absurd” and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning. The shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China’s growing influence. US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India’s top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported in April. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two per cent of the country’s population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan.

As he kick-started the second phase, Food Minister Rana Tanveer hinted at the possibility of further increasing the target to facilitate farmers. Passco had originally aimed to purchase 1.4m tonnes, but after farmers started protesting, the pressure on the federal and provincial governments piled on and the premier decided to increase the target to 1.8m tonnes. As of now, Passco has achieved 98 per cent of the initial target and distribution of gunny bags is already underway to meet the increased target. Farmers, however, are not happy with the government’s decision to procure slightly more wheat than intended. They said Passco — a federal body — operated in 13 out of 97 tehsils in Punjab and the decision to purchase additional wheat from designated areas would have a negligible impact. According to farmers, the tradeable surplus this year is expected to be about 10m tonnes and buying 400,000 tonnes would hardly make any difference. Punjab, on the other hand, is reluctant to procure wheat from growers despite province-wide agitations and the persistent stance of farmers. This has also caused a significant impact on the price of wheat, with the staple being sold at a rate much lower than the official price of Rs3,900 per 40kg. The Pakistan Kissan Ittehad claimed that farmers had lost Rs1,150 billion under the wheat head alone due to the crashing prices which reportedly dipped below Rs3,000 per 40kg. Instead of procurement, the Punjab government said it would compensate farmers with interest-free loans of Rs150bn. Kissan leader Khalid Mahmood Khokar, however, is not impressed, saying the paltry subsidy came at a cost of Rs1,150bn. “Instead of this gimmickry, please ensure an officially declared price, which the provincial government had itself calculated, announced, and promised,” Mr Khalid urged the Punjab government. The crisis Pakistan is going through the most difficult wheat season of its history, exacerbated by policy failure and the import of millions of tonnes of wheat shortly before the bumper harvest. The bumper crop followed a record import of 3.5m tonnes by the private sector allegedly due to the ‘weakness’ of the caretaker regime. Against the backdrop of such a huge import, hoarders also released their stock to earn profit. The releases of stock by the hoarders and the import of the commodity flooded the market and even met the “entire domestic requirement”, leaving Passco and the Punjab Food Department with 4m tonnes of unexhausted stock. “The 3.5m tonnes imports were staggered in a way, in the name of sustained supplies, that it overlapped with domestic harvesting season and created havoc for the domestic market,” explained Muhammad Ramzan, a wheat trader from Lahore. At the start of this month, the Punjab government had promised a probe into the wheat scandal against the backdrop of protests by the farmers. On Friday, the farmers resumed their protests from Multan against the provincial government’s decision to not buy wheat from farmers. At the protest, PKI leader Khokhar had said the agitation would continue against the government in every district of the province till the acceptance of their demands. He had said the federal government was procuring the wheat in 16 tehsils of the province, while the Punjab government had not purchased even a single grain so far. “Federal government should also buy wheat from other tehsils of the province,” he had demanded.

A day after the governor’s fiery speech, Chief Minister Gandapur warned Governor Kundi to stay within the limits of his constitutional position and avoid making olitical statements. After appearing in an anti-terrorism court in connection with the murder of former KP law minister Sardar Israrullah Khan Gandapur, the CM who belongs to the PTI said he could use his powers to banish Mr Kundi from Governor House. “This Governor House is not your property. Don’t force me to … turn it into a museum and open it for the public.” “I will shift you to a two-room annexe,” said Mr Gandapur. He went on to say that even fuel for the governor’s official vehicles comes from the budget of the provincial government and threatened to stop it if the governor who belongs to PPP didn’t refrain from “political statements, below-the-belt remarks and confrontation”. Gandapur warns Kundi will be banished from official residence for indulging in politics, confrontation “You’re the governor; politics is not your job,” Mr Gandapur warned, calling himself the elected representative who came to power with the voters’ mandate. The CM added that if the governor did not pay heed to his “warning”, he would seek his removal. “[T]he letter which notified you [as governor] will also denotify you.” In a hard-hitting speech on Friday, Governor Kundi had indirectly accused the CM of being involved in the killing of former law minister Mr Israrullah and ANP leader Umar Khattab Sherani. Mr Israrullah was killed in a suicide attack in his hometown of Kulachi near Dera Ismail Khan in October 2013. While government officials blamed the Wazi\xadris\xadtan-based Gandapur group for the bombing, a little-known shadowy group, Ansar\xad\xadul Mujahideen, claimed responsibility. ANP’s Mr Sherani was murdered in December 2021, a day before the province’s local government elections, which he was contesting as a candidate for the post of D.I. Khan mayor. The governor said that if he relinquished his constitutional post, he would prove to be a bigger nemesis for CM Gandapur. Mr Kundi also warned that protecting the Governor House was “his constitutional duty” and whoever tried to occupy it “would be dragged on roads”. This was an apparent reply to Mr Gandapur’s May 9 statement in which he warned against efforts to impose governor’s rule in KP and said PTI activists would occupy the Governor House. ‘Want good ties with CM’ Meanwhile, in conversation with Dawn, Mr Kundi said he hoped for good relations with the chief minister, but whoever talked about occupying the Governor House “will be answered befittingly”. People of KP shouldn’t suffer in the fight between the prime minister, governor and chief minister, he said, advising the provincial government to improve the law and order situation. He recalled the kidnapping of a sessions judge in Tank last month and claimed the chief minister paid extortion money for his release. Expected animosity The acrimonious relationship between the two leaders — both being bitter political rivals hailing from D.I.Khan — was expected since Mr Kundi was nominated for the post by his party’s chairman, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. The CM expressed his disapproval of the appointment by not attending  Mr Kundi’s oath-taking ceremony last Saturday. A few days later, on May 8, the governor KP did not sign a summary moved by the provincial government to convene an assembly session, forcing the provincial government to requisition the session through the speaker to present the current fiscal budget, according to sources.

All these men served as judges in the country’s high courts and the apex court before they retired to re-join the legal fraternity as seasoned practitioners of the law. For each of my requests, I receive either “excuse me”, or “sorry”. Finally, one of them agrees to talk — but not openly. “Please don’t mention my name,” says the retired Sindh High Court judge as our conversation ends. “You may write each and every word I have shared with you but not my name. I would prefer to be an anonymous source. One never knows here what can happen the next day: it’s better to stay away from even the memories of such controversial events.” The ordeal he recalls of that bloody Saturday refreshes the grim memories of the city being under siege for nearly 24 hours, held hostage by forces in the face of whom even jurists and law-enforcers were helpless. Two rival rallies had been planned that day — one by the legal fraternity, backed by parties then in the opposition, to welcome into the city the then deposed chief justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, and the other organised by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), favoured by the then military dictator General Pervez Musharraf, in protest against the “politicisation” of the issue of the presidential reference against Mr Chaudhry. A certain level of fear had prevailed, but no one could have guessed the deeply disturbing events that were to follow — certainly not the then serving high court judge. “I was travelling with my driver and armed guard to the Sindh High Court where the chief justice had to deliver an address when we were forced to stop near Sir Syed Girls College in Nazimabad,” he says. Armed motorcyclists surrounded his official, flag-bearing car, pulled out his driver and switched off its engine, seizing the keys. The bikers then bludgeoned the stationary car several times, so hard that its bumper fell off. In one of the busiest and most densely populated city neighbourhoods, a serving judge sat in fear. “I talked to them,” he says. “They were obviously aware that I was a high court judge. After debate and argument, they allowed me to leave but I reminded them that I couldn’t because keys of my car had been snatched by one of them.” Finally, the key was returned and the judge was ‘allowed’ to leave. As he got back into his car, the men surrounding him came up with their last strike: they stripped his car of the national flag. At the nearest police station of Pak Colony, he waited for nearly two hours for police security to arrive, as promised by the Governor’s House after it was informed about the episode. “Then came an SSP-ranking officer with his team to escort me,” he says. “The police left us some two kilometres from the Singh High Court building, saying that they could no longer help us. My driver parked the car at a safer place. Then, with my driver and guard, I walked to the high court to find all entrances blocked. Finally, I jumped over one of the walls to enter the building.” If this was the experience of a high court judge, one can only imagine the situation for political workers. In anticipation of the two rallies, law enforcers had been put on high alert the day before. The fire brigade had been directed to remain on standby and hospitals were asked to ready themselves. But the next day, hapless citizens found that the city had been abandoned by the law-enforcement agencies, and armed youths were wandering at will. Nasir Khan, one of the Awami National Party workers, witnessed a few of them at Malir Halt. I meet Nasir almost at the same spot where he narrowly escaped death. “As our rally from Quaidabad reached here [Malir Halt], it came under fire,” he says. “I miraculously remained unhurt but I watched two of my friends die from bullet wounds and several others fell injured. It was a terrible experience and even today I shiver while recalling that day.” After 10 years, only eyewitness accounts of the May 12 events remain. Justice and any action on the part of the state are still awaited. “Should we call ourselves humanity when the fallen remain un-avenged a year to a day since that fateful day in May?” wrote Justice Qazi Faez Isa, a Supreme Court judge and former chief justice of the Balochistan High Court, in this paper in 2008. Years later, the question remains pertinent. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2017 Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd. (www.compunode.com).Designed for Dawn.

The reforms go beyond just raising the retirement age or taxing pensions. Instead, a series of actions, similar to those that were done in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), should be seriously considered to reduce the cost of pensions to the government exchequer. The national pension cost will reach nearly Rs2 trillion in FY24, and it is predicted to rise to Rs10tr in the next decade if no reforms are implemented. In 2002-03, the pension cost stood at Rs25 billion, but in a span of just 20 years, it skyrocketed to over Rs1.5tr. Pension reforms have previously been tested in KP and generated the expected cost-saving results. It is high time to rationalise the existing pension programme and transition to more modern schemes available in developing and developed countries. Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb proposed to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years. It has sparked controversy over whether the government intends to benefit only a select few individuals. This decision has both advantages and disadvantages. In KP, the age restriction was raised to 63 years in 2019 with a projected annual savings of Rs20bn. However, the decision was reversed due to strong protest from bureaucrats, and the court also overturned the decision. However, KP’s other pension reforms remained in effect. KP Advisor on Finance Muzzammil Aslam has a different take on raising the age restriction than his predecessor, who implemented a series of reforms. Mr Aslam believes that the lump sum payment of pension payments will be delayed for the next five years, providing some breathing room for the time being. This will allow the government to show a lower budget deficit. The net impact will increase when the five-year allowances are added to the basic salary, which will be used to pay the pension. The age extension will postpone payments, but total payouts to employees will climb over the following five years. While these efforts provide some relief in the short term, crucial steps must be implemented to address the increasing pension liabilities. The government’s liabilities have jumped from Rs25bn in FY03 to Rs2tr in FY24 There is another idea to tax pensions. It may also face political challenges. However, the KP government has imposed a 5pc pension tax on grades 17 and above on their executive allowance. It is estimated that this measure alone will generate Rs150bn in contributions to a pay-as-you-go pension system. This was not an easy decision, but it was made in KP to obtain some contribution from existing employees. The federal government can look into this step in response to opposition to taxing pensions. KP reforms In 2004, based on recommendations from a World Bank project, the India implemented a national pension scheme wherein employee contributions are matched by the government. Pakistan did not choose to adopt it since it was not anticipated that the cost would rise so dramatically over the next 20 years. Taimur Khan Jhagra, former finance minister of KP, took the lead in implementing a series of pension reforms, including the introduction of a contributory pension scheme for new employees beginning July 1, 2022. Few substantial changes were made to the existing pension programme. A well-known 13-tier pension system was in place, covering the pensioner’s widow, children, parents, siblings, sisters, and grandchildren. KP confined it to direct dependents. The federal government did the same last year, but other provinces have not followed suit. The previous PTI government raised KP and Punjab’s minimum retirement age to 55 from 45, reducing KP’s pension bill by Rs20bn alone. KP consolidated various pensions into a single one. Previously, individuals could receive two pensions simultaneously, with an active employee receiving both a salary and a pension. The major reform is the implementation of a contributing pension scheme for new employees. Under this programme, the KP government contributes 12pc and employees contribute 10pc. So far, 40,000 staff have been hired under this system starting July 1, 2022. There are additional critical reforms that the KP and federal governments should implement, such as revisiting the single Universal Pay Scale between Grades 1 and 22. Pay in provinces is decoupled from the Centre and between departments, allowing each department to develop a pay scale appropriate for their budget and the market value of their professions. Pension reforms are greatly needed. The question is whether the state will be able to sustain pension payments for the next 10 to 15 years.

In the call, the two ladies can be heard criticising the coalition government made up of the parties that had ousted Khan’s regime in April 2022 through an act of parliament. At one point in the leaked conversation, the mother-in-law laments, “Yeh kambakht martial law bhi tau nahin lagaatay! [These cursed people don’t even impose martial law!]” By\xa0‘kambakht’,\xa0she meant the military establishment (ME). The conversation was surreal on many levels. Khan had been the ‘blue-eyed boy’ of the ME, until he had a falling out with his ‘makers’. From 2011 till he was elected as prime minister in 2018, the ME had successfully shaped Khan’s political rise in a highly coordinated manner. His ‘popularity’ was first established within the rank and file of the military. Then, some TV journalists were brought on board, followed by the induction of some vital members of the judiciary. This troika — the ME, the electronic media and the judiciary — was complimented by the trained social media wing of Khan’s PTI to proliferate narratives pitched against the two older mainstream parties, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The two were deeply demonised as being ‘corrupt’. After his ouster, Imran Khan was convinced that the establishment had ‘betrayed’ him, and the May 9-10 protests last year were an attempt to rally support amongst ‘pro-Khan’ factions in the military. However, any military intervention was drastically overestimated by his supporters A constituency that had initially been built by the former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf, and which mostly consisted of middle-class and upper-middle-class Pakistanis, was navigated by the ME and the media in such a manner that it eventually fell in Khan’s lap. This became a quadrilateral elite, comprising the ME, the media, the judiciary and the middle classes. After Khan’s ouster in April 2022, he began to publicly lambast the ME, accusing it of ‘betraying’ him. But the truth is, due to the many abject failures of Khan’s government, the ME had begun to gradually distance itself from him months before he was ousted. In February 2022, Bandial became the CJP. He was cut from the same cloth that at least four of his predecessors were. These included Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and, even more so, Justice Saqib Nasir, Justice Asif Khosa and Justice Gulzar Ahmad. Anti-PTI parties often accused them of being overtly pro-Khan. Justice Bandial was accused of having a ‘soft corner’ for Khan. Truth is, Bandial wasn’t very good at hiding this soft corner. Now the question is, during the time of the aforementioned phone call leak, when Khan was holding angry rallies and condemning the ME, why was Bandial’s mother-in-law yearning for a military takeover? Equally surreal was the presence of banners in some pro-Khan rallies with “We Want Martial Law” written on them. Also, why did the PTI — by planning last year’s violent riots on May 9 and 10, in which PTI supporters and members attacked military property — believe that this would cause a split in the armed forces and bring ‘pro-Khan’ generals to power? Many academics who study coups are of the view that, if the conditions allow, street protests can be followed by a coup d’etat. According to the political scientist Scott A Tyson, protests are often a ‘signal’ to the elites to intervene. The elites in this context are the military and political elites. These may also include the higher judiciary and business elites. A regime facing the protests, too, is made up of political elites. Once the anti-regime elites decide that the protests are clearly signalling for an intervention, this is then communicated to the state elites. The media too plays a role in this. Its reporting of the protests may strengthen the signal and galvanise the military to intervene. The mother-in-law’s ‘kambakht’ lament was expressing a desperate yearning within sections of economic elites for military intervention. This nature of signalling was loud and clear on numerous WhatsApp groups when Khan was holding rallies against his ouster. The signal became even more obvious when the “We Want Martial Law” banners began to appear at the rallies. Some media personnel also started enhancing the signal to the ME. But by late 2022, the ME’s top leadership had changed. A general who had earlier exited the project that was set up to facilitate Khan’s rise became the new army chief. Yet, PTI believed that many remnants of the project were still active within the military. I believe that with the judiciary still in facilitation mode, the notion of causing a split within the military to replace the new military chief with ‘pro-Khan’ generals was the brainwave of some retired military men who were well-versed in the theories of post-protest coups. Once the signal to intervene in Khan’s post-ouster rallies was ignored by the new ME, a violent uprising was conceived that was to target the new ME. The ‘uprising’ was enacted to evoke the ‘concerns’ of the supposed pro-Khan generals. The signal now was: eject the new army chief and intervene (on the side of Khan) to avoid an all-out civil war. This ‘plan’ could not have been formulated without the input of some retired officers. Many of them had been quite vocal in their support for Khan. The violent May 9 and 10 protests were orchestrated by a political elite (PTI) against another set of elites (the coalition government) to signal the need for an intervention to judicial and military elites. But, according to Tyson, whether or not a coup will succeed is generally not certain to elites. This uncertainty is caused by the uncertainty regarding the actions of other elites. The ‘other elite’, in the context of the May 9 and 10 riots, was the military. An intervention by ‘pro-Khan’ officers was drastically overestimated by the planners and the plan collapsed. The coalition government was able to withstand the assault. The new military chief began to swiftly oust the remaining ‘pro-Khan’ elements from the military — even though those remaining in the judiciary are now trying to avoid suffering a similar fate through a pushback in the name of the ‘independence of the judiciary.’\xa0This, too, is quite surreal.

As documented in the HRCP’s annual report, the year was nothing short of a human rights crisis on multiple fronts. Economic hardship was pervasive, with back-breaking inflation — nearly 40pc — and low growth hitting the common citizen the hardest. Protests were widespread, ranging from government employees striking against delayed salaries and pension issues to political demonstrations demanding timely elections. The state responded with indifference and sometimes outright violence, underlining its disregard for the people’s constitutional rights. The political arena was no less strained: the year saw unprecedented violence following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan; subsequent PTI-led riots were met with harsh government crackdowns. This included mass arrests and the controversial use of military courts for civilian trials. Political dissent was stifled and freedom of speech curtailed with internet shutdowns and media gags on reporting of certain political leaders. Sadly, the government’s management of the turmoil involved significant overreach, impacting judicial independence and skewing the electoral landscape. The swift passage of laws granting sweeping powers to intelligence agencies and restricting media freedoms points to the government’s alarming propensity to consolidate power at the cost of transparency and accountability. Human rights violations were not limited to political suppression. The report highlights severe abuses such as enforced disappearances, alleged extrajudicial killings and custodial torture by state agencies. The societal impact of these policies and actions has been devastating. Moreover, marginalised communities, including women, children, religious minorities, and transgender persons, faced increased violence and discrimination. Notable too was the harsh crackdown on peaceful assemblies like the Baloch Yakjehti Council’s protests. On the international front, despite engaging with global human rights mechanisms, Pakistan’s selective adherence to recommendations concerning enforced disappearances and the use of the death penalty reflected a reluctance to fully align with international human rights standards. Rulers would do well to remember that adhering to those standards will help maintain Pakistan’s desperately needed GSP-Plus status and be a more inviting place for foreign investment. As the year proceeds, it is imperative for the state to reconsider its approach to human rights. The government must ensure the independence of the judiciary, respect for democratic processes, and protection for all citizens against the abuse of power. Laws that infringe on freedom of expression and assembly should be reviewed and reformed. Additionally, there should be a concerted effort to address the economic inequalities that underpin much of the social unrest. For a stable and prosperous Pakistan, human rights must be more than an ideal; they must be an integral part of governance and everyday life.

The documentary shed light on various aspects of the life of Dr Aafia from her birth, education, marriage and to her kidnapping in Karachi and confinement in a notorious US prison. View this post on Instagram Aafia’s sister Dr Fowzia Siddiqui and Muslim Matters’ Editor-in-chief Hena Zuberi and others spoke at the event. Dr Fowzia said that her sister Dr Aafia was a gifted child, a bright scholar and a loving and caring person. She got a PhD degree in neurosciences from Brandies University of the US and it was her dream to revolutionise education system in Pakistan. In the documentary, human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, who currently represents Dr Aafia, said a vast majority of the American people had no idea who Dr Aafia was and they also did not care. He said that she has suffered a lot in the US prison and braved all sorts of torture. El-Hajj Mauri Saalakhan, the founding president and director of operations at The Aafia Foundation, told the documentary makers that after 9/11, the US targeted the human rights and liberties of people, especially Muslims. He said Dr Aafia also fell prey to this victimisation and in 2003 she was kidnapped, along with her children, in Karachi and got disappeared on mere suspicion that her husband had bought online night vision goggles. Umme Muhammad, the president of the Musawemem Campaign, said for the last 15 years she had been linked to the case of Dr Aafia but disappointingly nothing more could be achieved. She said Dr Aafia was targeted only because she was Muslim. Yvonne Ridley was amongst the first investigative journalists who told the world that Dr Aafia was jailed in Afghanistan. Talking about the grey lady prisoner of Bigram jail, she said in those times the US administration would dehumanise the prisoners and the same was done to Dr Aafia. She was wounded by the US soldiers and in injured condition she was brought to the US and tried by a court in a highly biased manner and jailed for long 86 years, which means the rest of her life. Zeina El-Debis, leader of the Friends of Aafia and founder of the Shade of Mercy Foundation, talked about their efforts to get Dr Aafia repatriated on humanitarian grounds.

This, of course, is a cliché. But it happens to be a cliché that is quite literally true. Here is why.\xa0 Pakistan’s ‘youth bulge’ is palpable. Just over two out of every three Pakistanis today are below the age of 30 and just under one in every three is between 15 and 29 years of age (our definition of youth). What the demographic momentum imbedded in this one statistic implies is that Pakistan is not just a young country, but that it is going to remain young till at least to 2050, possibly longer. \xa0More importantly, my own research suggests that the youth of Pakistan\xa0know\xa0this and they expect being given the attention and respect this demographic reality demands. Others who have looked at the question have come to similar conclusions. But the fact of the matter is that we do not need statistics to tell us that Pakistan is a young country. You just need to look around you. Any street. Any marketplace. Advertising on your television set. Certainly, on your Twitter feed. Any political\xa0jalsa [gathering]. Any office. Even elected officials and unelected political influentials. The generational change is not on its way. It’s here. It’s set. And, most importantly, it’s here to stay. At least for, and probably for more than, the next two decades. With the majority of Pakistan’s population below the age of 30, the young will invariably influence the country’s future trajectory. However, where the youth of today take this country will depend on the choices that today’s policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make. Eos presents an excerpt from an essay by Adil Najam from the book Pakistan: Search for Stability, published by Oxford University Press… BEING YOUNG IN PAKISTAN In 2017, the\xa0Pakistan Human Development Report\xa0produced a comprehensive profile of youth in Pakistan, including a wealth of empirical and opinion data on the young, collected from an estimated 130,000 Pakistanis. However, the key question that we, the authors of the report, were most concerned with was “what does it mean to be young in Pakistan?” Not surprisingly, no easy answers were forthcoming. Like so many other places in the world, being young in Pakistan is both exciting and frustrating. The space that the young occupy in Pakistani society is vast and full of possibilities but, in their own words, is often described as crumbling, contested and constrained on the one hand, and uneven, unfair and uncertain on the other. It is a space that is defined by high hopes, but also deep fears. As subsequent research and events have confirmed, to be young in Pakistan is to be highly agitated, and very often angry. Our research does begin pointing out some of the reasons why this is so. For example, if you were to computationally condense the over 60 million young Pakistanis aged between 15 and 29 into a statistically representative one hundred young people, you would find that just 30 of them consider themselves to be functionally literate, 29 would never have gone to school (despite all being 15 or above), only 6 would have 12 or more years of education and just 39 would be employed. More telling, however, are the structural depravations which highlight that the space ‘to be young’ is severely constrained and shrinking. Of the 100, only six would have access to a library, only seven to a sports facility, just 21 to a park. Only three would have ever been to a cinema, only three to a live music performance. Fifty-nine would say that they do not play sports, or only infrequently. One in the 100 would own a car, 12 a motorcycle, 10 a bicycle and 77 would have no means of personal mobility. Each of these depravations becomes even more acute for women, rural youth, and other marginalised groups within the young. And, yet, within this notional 100, we also found a spirit of great national pride, high aspirations, much hope, and tremendous expectations. They were eager to announce, to any who wish to ride the tiger of Pakistan’s youth, to never forget that this is a generation that demands and deserves better. They are politically excited, excitable and astute. While only 24 percent said (in 2016) that they trusted political leaders, 90 percent of young men and 55 percent of young women claimed that they would vote in the next elections. Of every 100, 48 believe that Pakistan’s future will be bright — although 36 fear it will be bleak. Most tellingly, 67 [of the 100] believe that their lives are and should be better than their parents, only 15 expect themselves to be worse-off than their parents; 89 say they feel happy; 70 say they feel safe. All of them demand the space and conditions in which they can achieve their aspirations. In short, the world of young Pakistanis is as diverse, as differentiated, and as divided as the rest of Pakistan. However, they also have greater expectations and aspirations which, if nurtured, could yield high dividends. Much more telling, however, is the palpable impatience and restlessness which, if ignored, could result in disaster. There are three things to keep in mind as we think about youth anywhere in the world, but certainly in the context of Pakistan. First, and most importantly, youth is\xa0a defining category. The reason to think of the young as a category is not just because they are so many, but because — even if they were not this many — the 15-29 year age bracket is where ‘citizenship’ matures. Second, youth is fleeting. Analytically, too, youth is a transitory and\xa0dynamic category. Because changes happen fast and furious when one is young, the definition of youth identity and what it stands for can change rapidly, even whilst within that category. Those turning 15 or 16 today can find themselves very distant from those turning 28 or 29 and will very likely not easily recognise the passions of those who would be 16 by the time they turn 28. This may well be true for other categories too but is consequential here, because the short window of this category and the rapid changes within it make notions of what “youth believe”, \xa0“youth stand for”, \xa0and “youth want”, or even ideas of the “youth vote”, are much more transitory and contestable than many analysts assume, and do compound the challenges of youth representation. Finally, youth — especially in Pakistan — is an extremely\xa0diverse category. At one level, any category of well over 60 million individuals cannot possibly be homogenous and would demand an investigation into its internal contradictions. But, much more than that, each of the major cleavages that exist in Pakistani society are compounded in its young: gender, class, rural-urban, wealth, technology, ethnicities, religiosity and sectarianism, and geography. PAKISTAN AND ITS YOUNG: THREE PROPOSITIONS Building and extending on the available research, let us review three key propositions — political, societal and developmental — on how the young of Pakistan might influence the future trajectories of the country’s society and politics. These propositions are offered not as predictions or scenarios, but as choice points. Embedded within each proposition are levers of possible change — where the youth of today take this country will very much depend on the choices that policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make on each of these dimensions. Proposition 1:\xa0The young of today are defining tomorrow’s politics, but not always in ways we imagine On the face of it, the bold sounds, sights, language, and even substance of Pakistan politics today seems driven by the young. Even where mainstream political parties are still led by septuagenarians, they wrap themselves in the emblems of youth; political rallies of all parties, even religious ones, feel like high-intensity concerts; political communication is not only geared towards the young but most often crafted by them. On the one hand, this is not entirely new, nor surprising. On the other, however, there is something palpably different, as if what would have been ‘regular’ youthfulness is now on steroids. There is significant reason to believe why it is, and will remain, so. At a basic demographic level, all political actors realise how the maths works: the young are the single largest bloc of new and impressionable voters in Pakistan and there is a long-term and steady supply of them. The demography described in the\xa0Pakistan National Human Development Report\xa0suggests that every election in Pakistan between now and around 2050 will be defined by the youth vote — including, of course, by their choice to vote or not. Notwithstanding the dichotomy of young Pakistanis claiming high intent to vote and a history of not having done so in the past, the number of young entrants into the voting mix means that, mostly within two election cycles, today’s new voter would be about to — or would already have — enter(ed) a burgeoning 30-49 years middle-age category historically the most reliable and loyal voting group in Pakistan. The political logic of investing in the young voter is impeccable. But demography alone does not explain the dominance of the youth voice in Pakistani politics today. Technology seems to have played an even more defining role; a role that is likely to be as enduring. That the rise of ‘new’ (especially social) media would trigger a steep decline of the ‘old’ (particularly print) media was probably inevitable, but the ‘control’ younger political operatives now exert over social media in all political groupings is remarkable and is now driving significant parts of the political narratives in the country. Of course, certain leaders and parties have capitalised more on courting the youth vote than others and have been differently successful in it. This matters, but mostly in ways that it has always mattered. One should not expect permanence in youth loyalties, not least because it remains a dynamic and diverse category.\xa0 It remains to be seen if the current and emerging youth bulge will practically change ballot box behaviour, but conditions are certainly ripe to create the possibility. Finally, a very remarkable feature of Pakistan’s emergent political discourse is how explicit mention of youth issues is nearly absent from political narratives. This, despite the feverish pitch of the political discourse, despite the active participation of the young in this discourse, and even despite the role the young are clearly playing in shaping the narratives. A possible explanation for this anomaly could be that politically active youth in Pakistan have convinced themselves that the pathway to material benefits for themselves — particularly, for example, in the area of employment and improved living conditions — lies through the choice of political leadership rather than of policy. Proposition 2:\xa0Give the young the ability to be young or expect a Pakistan tomorrow that is as divided as it is today The idea that we are denying the young in Pakistan the space to be young is a major finding of the\xa0Pakistan National Human Development Report. But it is a thought that first hit me like a ton of bricks in December 2014, as I visited the New Muslim College in Charsadda — just days after the horrific terrorist attack at the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar — to hold a focus group discussion with 15-18-year-olds on what young Pakistanis were thinking. It struck me that the young men with me in the room were not much older than the students who had died at APS just a few days ago, or those who had done the horrific killing. The reality of the APS attack hung heavy in the room and I realised, as did they, that it is the young in Pakistan who have had to do much of the dying in the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ But there was also a palpably steely resolve in the room. Here is what I wrote about that encounter: “Unlike every other APS conversation I had been hearing — on television, on social media, from politicians, in drawing rooms — theirs was devoid of sloganeering. There was no sign of despair. No hollow display of anger or anguish. No camouflaging of fear with bravado. Instead, there was resolve. Very endearing. Very becoming. Very mature. A very matter-of-fact recognition that this was the reality of the Pakistan they had inherited. A reality they now have to live with…” It is then that I fully realised the perils of being young in Pakistan. “Extremists are out to indoctrinate the young. Terrorists are out to kill them. Educational institutions can neither guarantee quality education nor physical security. An emergent politics of anger uses the passions of the young as fuel for petty politicking. The result is that the space for the young to be young has shrunk — is endangered.” My research has convinced me that the best gift that Pakistan can give to its young is to return to them the ability to be young. Indeed, it may be the best gift Pakistan can give itself — a future where this ability continues to be denied cannot be good for any Pakistani. Being young is not just about being carefree, it is also about being able to explore. In the shrinking space to be able to do so, the young in Pakistan have already inherited most of the societal divides that define the country as a whole. That as many young Pakistanis consider being a Pakistani as their primary identity as consider their religion to be their primary identity, is probably reflective of society as a whole. But what was the most disturbing aspect of our research was that more than 40 percent young men and 50 percent young women disapproved of having friendly relations with someone from another religion, or even another sect; nearly three out of every four young Pakistanis (men and women) responded that they would disapprove of someone from a different religion or sect preaching their religion. The distrust that defines Pakistani society as a whole is equally prevalent amongst the young.\xa0 Just over 20 percent said they trusted politicians, only around 25 percent trust the police, just 40 percent had trust in the judiciary and less than 50 percent in the media. All of this was in 2016, and there is enough reason to believe that trust amongst the young has only eroded further since then. Such a snapshot should be read not just as what the youth of today think, but what the Pakistan of tomorrow is likely to think. The challenges of social division, societal distrust and mutual intolerance are clearly great, but solutions are available. Silly as it may sound to some, given the enormity of the challenges, the very first — and possibly most meaningful, although not always easy — step should be resolute policy in allowing the young to be young. Sports grounds are not a big investment, but they can be more meaningful than we might think. It is remarkable how parochial we have become, and simple steps to enhance mobility for the young, including the ability for travel exchange within the country to get to meet other Pakistanis who may not look like us but are equally Pakistanis, is another small but possibly impactful investment. Safe and affordable mobility (along with reliable childcare and clean bathrooms) for young women, in fact, emerges as amongst the most effective means of significantly increasing women’s participation in the workforce. Obvious as it should be by now, it is worth noting that, as we think about youth as a category for social analysis, now and into the future, the simple dichotomy of ‘young vs old’ is not only un-useful but can also be dangerous. In society, as in politics, some of the greatest and most alienating divisions that exist in Pakistan exist amongst the young themselves. The policy challenge is to find ways to reduce these divisions now before they sink deep roots and are passed on to the future, and to future generations. The goal is not empty slogans of ‘integration’, but investing in practical means for the young in Pakistan to interact with other young people in Pakistan. Across divisions of gender, class, geography, religion and rural-urban-metropolitan, the bridges that need to be built are not just of concrete but of conversation. Proposition 3: ‘Boom or bust?’ — it’s a choice We began the\xa02017 Pakistan National Human Development Report\xa0with a story that is not from Pakistan. It remains valid and is worth repeating here: “On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in a small town in Tunisia set himself on fire, following a confrontation with a municipal official about where his cart was parked. While the specifics of what led to Mohamed Bouazizi’s death are unclear, what is indisputable is his fatal self-immolation catalysed protests that toppled Tunisia’s dictator and led to a string of uprisings in the region that came to be called the Arab Spring. “The aim of mentioning this situation here is not to recount what happened in Tunis that day, or in the other countries of the Arab Spring subsequently. [Our concern is] with Pakistan’s youth. So, fast forward to Pakistan. “Can you imagine a situation, anywhere in Pakistan, where a young person feels so frustrated by unemployment, or so disheartened, un-empowered and marginalised, that he takes a measure as extreme as Bouazizi did in Tunisia? One certainly hopes not. But hope alone is not enough. It is the responsibility of the state as well as society to enable an environment for our youth where such a fate is not even imaginable. Not even in our worst nightmares.” Trying to predict whether Pakistan’s demographic youth momentum will end up being a ‘boom’ or a ‘bust’ is a fool’s errand. That Pakistan today has the largest number of young people it has ever had and that this number is set to grow over the next multiple decades, is a fact. How this fact will play out is not a matter of reading tea leaves, it is a matter of policy choice. There is the inherent potential of a ‘boom’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new young entrants into the economy can become motors of consumption, generators of ideas and innovation and harbingers of new social energy. There is also the equally inherent potential of a ‘bust’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new entrants into the economy need new employment, can feel suffocated by the lack of room to grow, and can burn with anger when existing systems they wish for are not enabled to change. Certainly not as simple as it may sound, but the final path taken does depend on the choices made by policy, by society, and by the young themselves.

If jailed PTI leader and former prime minister Imran Khan’s article in UK’s conservative right-wing Telegraph newspaper blaming the military leadership directly for all his woes the week before was not hint enough of the state of play, two public statements by the latter clarified issues rather unambiguously. The first came in the DG ISPR’s press briefing, which was ostensibly called to discuss Afghanistan-based terrorist groups’ involvement in attacks on Chinese nationals working on development projects in the country. But in response to a couple of questions about the PTI and Imran Khan related to the events of May 9 last year, the DG ISPR stated unequivocally that the only path to rehabilitation for the political party and its leaders was to ‘seek forgiveness for attacking your own forces’. Then, perhaps, talks could happen and that too with ‘political parties’ (ie, the government), as the military had ‘nothing to do with politics’. Imran Khan has been consistent in saying he wouldn’t talk to the ‘powerless political parties’ and that a meaningful dialogue is possible only with the military. The DG ISPR also lamented the delay in the prosecution and sentencing of all those responsible for the May mayhem — including the ‘leaders and mastermind’ against whom ‘irrefutable evidence’ has been gathered and submitted — and, in doing so, appeared to hint at the establishment’s frustrations with what it perceives as roadblocks being erected by the judiciary. The content of the live presser evoked an equally adamant response from the PTI, which went on the offensive, reiterating its stance that May 9 was a ‘false flag operation’, accusing the military’s spokesman of being economical with the truth, and saying it would be happy to live with the findings of an impartial judicial commission into the May 9 events and would even apologise if found to be at fault. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. The military spokesman had pre-empted this demand in his briefing earlier by saying if a probe were to happen, as was being demanded, it ought to start with 2014, and not nine years later. The 2014 PTI sit-in in the federal capital was said to have been instigated and backed by the then ISI chief. This was the first indication that the military was prepared to hold its own accountable for past follies, if it paved the way for the trials and sentencing of PTI leaders it says were responsible for the attacks on defence installations in a number of cities in Punjab and KP. While the spokesman left nothing to the imagination, on the first anniversary of May 9, the army chief added his voice to his chief spokesman’s in terms of stressing the need for punishing the perpetrators of the violence a year earlier, also lashing out against what he called ‘digital terrorism’. This indicates that harsher curbs on social media are planned. So far, the PTI has had overwhelming social media dominance and had been able to keep a step ahead of its adversaries, but we will find out soon whether it has what it takes to bypass software the Chinese have developed over the years (and Pakistan has reportedly acquired) and successfully used to block dissident content. With this ever-widening gulf between the establishment and the party it once saw as a panacea for all that ails Pakistan, the one thing that many felt could force a rethink in the establishment would have been a public manifestation of the immense support enjoyed by the PTI, as evidenced in last February’s elections. Many Pakistan watchers keenly waited all day for multitudes of PTI supporters to spill out onto the roads and streets of major urban conurbations on the party leader’s call to ‘break the shackles’ and protest on May 9. But the brutal crackdown of the past one year seems to have knocked the wind out of the party’s sails and worn down the workers’ will. People may turn out to vote for it in droves, but did not appear prepared to risk life, limb and liberty in coming out for mass protests. Some small localised protests did happen, but had zero impact in the sense of influencing decision-making in the corridors of power. Going forward, a couple of factors will play a role in steering developments. The first and foremost will be the confidence the army chief has in his control over his institution. His predecessor appointed a dozen major generals to three stars in his final six weeks in office and left the incumbent little room in terms of forming his own team. Natural attrition and the more dramatic exit of a couple of three stars on disciplinary grounds recently has, 18 months down the line, given the chief an opportunity to place senior officers of his own choosing in key roles which will give him greater freedom of action both inside and outside the institution. The promotion of three officers this week, including the DG ISPR, to three stars was another step in that direction. The military saw May 9 as a coup against the chief, a failed attempt to dislodge him from office. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. With the PTI protests failing to gather momentum, the only impediment in his path seems to be an increasingly assertive superior judiciary. It can and will, in all likelihood, challenge the establishment’s pre-eminence in decision-making. It isn’t clear how the latter plans to deal with that, especially because it believes that a direly needed economic revival is only possible under the umbrella of a hybrid set-up and in a relatively calm political environment. Only the judiciary can rock its boat now.

Copyright © 2024, Dawn NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Education emergency - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'ON Wednesday, the prime minister announced an education emergency at a conference in Islamabad. Though post-18th Amendment, education has been a provincial subject, the prime minister said that the emergency was for the country and he would work with all provinces and chief ministers to ensure cooperation, compliance and follow-up. Representatives from the provinces were present at the conference. About 26.2 million children between five and 16 years are out of school in the country. For those who are in school, most are provided with a poor quality of education. Access to quality education depends, almost exclusively, on parental income levels: if you have the income, you can get your child a decent quality of education. Otherwise, your child is either not in school, or enrolled in a government or low-fee private school. Most such schools provide poor quality education. Article 25-A, which says that “free and compulsory” education would be provided to all five- to 16-year-olds in the country, was added to the basic rights section of our Constitution in 2010. Fourteen years later, we are declaring an emergency to do what we had promised our children in the Constitution as a basic right! In an earlier speech, the prime minister had called this criminal negligence. It is surely more than that. The meaning of ‘emergency’, according to one dictionary, is “a serious, unexpected, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action”. The situation is definitely serious and dangerous as far as the state of education in the country is concerned. But it is not unexpected: it has been the result of decades of a deliberate and purposeful neglect of education. The current situation is the result of the choices that we have made and are still making. Even today, when international bodies recommend a minimum expenditure of four per cent of GDP on education, our government spends 1.7pc or so. The situation is also not unexpected, given that educationists, researchers, academics, civil society representatives, teachers, parents and children who have been talking of this neglect for years have not been heard. Every education policy of the past has also had aspirations to universalise education. We started off in the right direction with the first education conference held in 1947, but we have yet to universalise education. The current situation is the result of the choices that we, as a society, have made and are still making. Given this, the bit on emergencies ‘requiring immediate action’ is the part that is yet to happen. While announcing the emergency, there was nothing about what steps would be taken to address the situation, what policy changes would take place, and when the state would invest more in education and how. When will all this start? How will it be implemented? Who will monitor the implementation and ensure we move towards the goal of ‘access to quality education for all children’, and how do we ensure all this is not just rhetoric and that actual action will indeed follow? The prime minister did say he will be monitoring the situation himself. It is good to have that level of commitment, but given the demands on a prime minister’s time, this might not work. It was also mentioned that there will be a ‘task force’ to look at issues of implementation. The task force, its mandate and power, its modus operandi, have not been announced as yet. Let us see when the follow-up happens. Clearly, a lot of urgent and comprehensive work is needed if we are going to live up to our promises of providing access to quality education to all our children. If it takes the cloak of an emergency to do it, so be it. But the proof will be in the actions that start now, and in outcomes that are achieved as a result. Otherwise, it is all rhetoric and it will be another opportunity wasted. There might not be one programme that all the governments follow. Given the varied conditions and circumstances across the provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory, if governments have their own priorities in line with local conditions, this is not an issue. In fact, it is better this way, as local programming will create local buy-in as well. But there has to be a clear declaration of priorities by all governments and, subsequently, the action plans they will follow. Pakistan has some 100,000 schools in the public sector and more than 250,000 in total. Similarly, we have about 1m teachers in the public sector, and more than 2m teachers overall working in the education sector. We are still short of schools as well as teachers. So, we are talking of a very large system here. Reform of a large system or change in a large system will require large and deep interventions. Small initiatives here and there, as governments have been taking in education for quite some time, are not going to be enough to address the issue of 26.2m out-of-school children or the quality of education issues for the millions who are in schools. We need more schools, teachers and classes; we need to revamp our assessment and examination systems; we need to redo our curricula and books; we need to upgrade teaching skills and content knowledge of teachers; we need better governance structures in the public sector. All this and more needs to be done at scale and quickly. This will require more resources and it will require a lot of focus on prioritising and coordinating. And it will need high levels of competence as well. By invoking an emergency, the prime minister has said he is putting his weight behind all this. Let us see if this is anything more than rhetoric.

Copyright © 2024, Dawn NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Street safety - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'THE Sindh chief executive’s resolve to address street crime is encouraging. This commitment raises important questions: are these crimes organised or opportunistic? Can traditional policing strategies alone be effective, or is a blend of conventional and technological methods required? How important is educating the public on safety measures for the prevention of street crime? Also, one must consider whether street crime is predominantly an urban or rural phenomenon. Street crimes typically include the snatching of mobile phones, cash, and motorcycles by individuals aged between 18 and 35. The environment, such as street lighting, architectural designs, and administrative practices, also plays a significant role in these incidents. Although initially appearing to be opportunistic, these crimes are increasingly becoming organised, driven by environmental and situational factors. They usually occur in densely populated and economically disadvantaged areas, particularly where there is minimal surveillance, such as lack of CCTV, private security, and alarm systems. Several factors contribute to the rise in street crime, including high unemployment rates, poverty, easy access to small arms, a low criminal conviction rate, enticing high-value items, insufficient police presence, low CCTV coverage, weak police-community collaboration, and limited public knowledge on safety practices. Hiring unverified labourers and domestic workers in urban areas like Karachi also plays a role. The psychological impact is significant, leading to increased feelings of insecurity and a rise in mental health issues among residents. Recent reports indicate a significant surge in street crime in Karachi, with daily occurrences of theft and violence. However, lengthy processes and low trust between police and the public often prevent victims from reporting crimes. Streamlining the process for registering FIRs could enhance public trust and provide more accurate crime data. Karachi Police, with a force of 44,000 personnel, dedicates only 13,500 to patrol duties, with the remainder assigned to non-patrol roles. This distribution poses challenges in effectively managing street crime, as traditional policing methods often result in unsuccessful investigations. Karachi’s unchecked demographic changes have led to the unregulated growth of slums, necessitating the establishment of a ‘Slums Regulatory Authority’ to oversee these areas and ensure proper integration of newcomers from other cities with collaboration between union councils, police, and Nadra. To effectively prevent crime such as auto theft and ATM robberies, improvements in vehicle security, increased surveillance around ATMs, and greater police visibility are essential. To address such challenges in Pakistan, the police introduced the Ababeel, Mujahid, Shaheen, and Dolphin squads, but public expectations require a more proactive approach and technological backup. Traditional policing methods may result in faulty investigations. International examples, such as Malaysia’s successful strategies, can offer valuable insights. These include enhanced police visibility, identifying crime hotspots, and fostering police-community partnerships, which have proven effective in improving public safety and reducing crime rates. To effectively combat street crime, the police should harness advanced technologies like AI, CCTV and mobile apps to detect crime and aid their prevention. Facial and licence plate recognition are key to identifying and managing offenders, while GPS tracking is invaluable for recovering stolen vehicles and monitoring taxis. However, relying solely on technology is not enough to re\xad\xadduce street crime. Effective law en\xad\xadforcement and ac\xad\xadtive communi\xad\xadty engagement are equally crucial. Police need increased mobility, and the mo\xad\xadtorcycle busin\xadess, including vehicle registration, requires stringent regulation. Initiatives like Safe City projects should be launched in major cities such as Karachi to enhance urban security. As most street crimes occur after sunset, identifying and reinforcing hotspots with security and lightingand public education on safety are imperative. Improving the justice system is essential to addressing inefficiencies and corruption. Enhancing investigation quality, prosecution, and witness cooperation is vital for increasing conviction rates. Citizen education regarding the safe use of mobiles, safe car parking, using ATMs, etc, should be part of urban policing. For this purpose, all capital police departments in Pakistan should initiate citizen-police education initiatives, including through distance learning. A holistic approach involving technology, community engagement, political will, professional policing, and responsible citizenry is necessary to deter and defeat street crime.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Esther Perez Ruiz, the Fund’s resident representative for Pakistan, said: “A mission team led by Nathan Porter, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan, will meet with authorities next week to discuss the next phase of engagement. “The aim is to lay the foundation for better governance and stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economic growth that will benefit all Pakistanis,” she added. Pakistan last month completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but the government has stressed the need for a fresh, longer-term programme. Last week, the Fund said that a mission was expected to visit Pakistan this month to “discuss the FY25 budget, policies, and reforms under a potential new programme for the welfare of all Pakistanis”. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the $350bn economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. On Friday, the Fund said that downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the IMF in its staff report following the second and final review under the standby agreement. The Fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation.

Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

As he met players of the men’s national team in the Irish capital of Dublin, the PCB quoted him as saying: “Fight till the last ball; the competition should be apparent.” On Friday, Ireland recorded their maiden T20 win against Pakistan who could not defend a solid-looking 182-5 after being put in to bat first, dealing a shocking blow to the Babar Azam-led side’s preparations for the World Cup, which is taking place next month in the United States. The loss to Ireland, who are in Pakistan’s group in the T20 World Cup, came after a series draw on home soil to a New Zealand squad missing most of their first-choice players. With Babar only recently reinstated as captain, it was another bump in the road for their tournament preparation. Today’s match will start at 7pm, with Ireland leading the series by 1-0. In a post on X, the PCB shared a video of Naqvi meeting the Green Shirts and speaking to them, adding that a detailed discussion on the action plan took place during the two-hour-long meetup. Encouraging the team, the PCB chairman urged the players to play with hard work, passion and a “professional approach”. He noted that T20 cricket needed a unique and aggressive approach, adding that victory was only possible if cricket was played in a “modern manner”. “An action plan can be formulated while sitting in a room but the real test is on the ground, where the performance should be visible,” the PCB quoted him as telling the team. Naqvi praised all players as “undoubtedly talented, professional and the best”, adding that the team’s bowling attack was “splendid”. However, he emphasised that great attention was required when fielding so that the opponent “cannot get any chance” to score. “The players are the hope for Pakistan and you have to meet the nation’s expectations. Teamwork is the fundamental thing for victory,” the PCB chairman said. He noted that the public loved cricket and had expectations from the team. Naqvi said that success would come if all 11 of the players in the team performed with unity. “No one is accepting the loss in the first match against Ireland. The real test after Ireland and England is the World Cup,” he added. Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

In a recent interview to SAMAA TV, he emphasised the urgent need for men to take the lead in condemning and criminalising harassment in all its forms. He also took pride in belonging to a family that boasts accomplished women. “I’m very proud of them and grateful. It’s a fact that when women in your family are independent and powerful, they can support you and become your strength. But it is unfortunate that even today, women have to face harassment in all professional fields, whether it’s the corporate [world] or the showbiz.” The Pyarey Afzal and Alif actor added that the onus of fostering a safe and supportive environment for women lies on men because they’re the ones to blame for perpetuating a culture of silence and complicity. Calling for greater solidarity from men and emphasising the importance of creating inclusive environments where women can thrive professionally, Abbasi said, “We [men] should play a leading role in this situation. “We have to make sure that wherever we see harassment, we don’t accept it. We demonise it. We don’t encourage or normalise it. Because unfortunately, we, men, have normalised and celebrated such behaviour. We didn’t scrutinise it the way it should have been scrutinised. So we need to call out and criminalise such behaviour in our circles,” he added. Abbasi commended women who have spoken up against harassment and encouraged dialogue around the issue. “It gives me great optimism that in today’s day and age, women are very forthcoming and are calling out harassment, whether it’s online or at the workplace. The times when women would face harassment and stay mum about it are thankfully behind us.” The Legend of Maula Jatt star emphasised the need to encourage such behaviour among women. “The culture of speaking up also needs to be encouraged. Women should be able to make noise wherever they are if ever they face harassment of any kind. Without any fear or hesitation, women should be encouraged to raise hell. We need to eradicate the element of fear and shame among women.” By speaking out against harassment, Abbasi sends a powerful message to men everywhere — it is incumbent upon us to stand up, speak out, and actively work towards creating a world where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.

But for Hindu supremacy to be fully realised, which is the stated aim of Hindu nationalists, they will have to expunge India of any Muslim influence, of which there is much, historically. When Indians cast their vote in the coming weeks, they would do well to be aware of the weight of their electoral choices. And the international community would do well not to drop the ball on India. In a recent article, political scientists, Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs asked the rhetorical question: “Is India under Narendra Modi … beginning to resemble the American South under Jim Crow?” referring to state and local laws introduced in the southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th century that enforced racial segregation. They explain that Jim Crow laws were aimed at blunting the Reconstruction Amendments that abolished slavery and gave equal rights to Blacks. They were designed to make Blacks second-class citizens. Similarly, in India, Hindu nationalists seek to diminish the constitutionally guaranteed equal citizenship of Muslims and turn them into marginalised, less than fully equal citizens. Jim Crow laws lasted for almost a century, ending only in the 1960s. Varshney and Staggs claim that since Hindu nationalism is in its early phase, it could still be forestalled before it is institutionalised via political and legislative processes. They suggest that the ongoing national elections present an opportunity for Indians to do that. However, the comparison between Jim Crow and Hindu nationalism diverges in their ultimate objectives. While Jim Crow merely targeted the equal citizenship of Blacks, Hindu nationalism has a more totalitarian goal. To fully grasp the end-goals of Hindu nationalism or Hindutva, it is necessary to read its foundational texts. There are none more seminal than We or Our Nationhood Defined (1939) by Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, who led the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) from 1940 to 1973. The RSS is considered the heart and soul of the vast network of Hindu nationalist organisations, of which the BJP is the political wing. Narendra Modi, a life-time member and former official of the RSS, credited it for grooming him to political leadership. In his text, Golwalkar writes of his wariness of “hostile elements” within the country that “act as menace to national security”, singling out Muslims as the number one threat, followed by Christians. His solution to “the danger of a cancer developing into its body politic” was offering the “foreign element” two options: “either to merge themselves in the national race and adopt its culture or to live at its mercy so long as the national race may allow it to do so, and to quit the country at the sweet will of the national race”. MS Golwalkar. Credit: Golwalkarguruji.org — image via Scroll.in Another of the movement’s foundational texts is Essentials of Hindutva (1923) by Vinayak Damodar Savakar, who is considered by many to be the foremost Hindutva thinker. In Essentials, he provided Hindu nationalism with an ideology, which in a nutshell claims that India was special, as it offered something nobody else could — Hindu thought. This unique Hindu supremacy, Savarkar believed, was under threat because of the presence of non-Hindus. He called on Hindus, fragmented as they were, to unite and reclaim their supremacy. Violence against Muslims, Savarkar said, was the means to achieve that goal. Golwalkar drew on Savarkar’s thoughts. He also admired the race theories of fascist Germany and Italy and recommended that Hindustan, the land of Hindus, should profit from their lessons. In We or Our Nationhood Defined, he wrote: “To keep up the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of its semitic races — the Jews. Race pride at its highest has been manifested here.” Golwalkar saw the world in apocalyptic terms. His objective was clear: “To rule over the world was the heavenly task ordained to Hindu race.” He called upon Hindus to “rally to the Hindu standard, the bhagwa dhwaj [and] set our teeth in grim determination to wipe out the opposing forces”. Some Hindutva leaders today have explicitly articulated this vision. For instance, in March 2020, a Hindu priest named Yati Narsinghanand, who is the president of Akhil Bharatiya Sant Parishad (All India Priests Council) and someone close to the BJP, was reported to have told his followers, “Humanity can only be saved if Islam is finished off. Hindus: Read the Gita along with Mahabharat, and learn how to die fighting.” This call was made around the time BJP leader Kapil Mishra was leading processions in Delhi calling for violence against the mainly Muslim participants in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, chanting the mantra: “Desh ke ghaddaron ko, goli maro saalon ko [Shoot the traitors of the country].” In 2023, another BJP leader, an MLA from Telangana, T Raja Singh, at a rally in Mumbai, urged his audience to take to arms. “I would like to request all my Hindu brothers that the coming time is the time of struggle, it is the time of war,” he said. “Every Hindu is obliged to unite. Hindu should not become one who rings temple bells, but rather he should become a Hindu who kills landyas”, a derogatory reference to Muslims. At a public meeting of Hindu priests in December 2021, in the holy town of Haridwar, a star speaker, Annapurna Maa, the general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, was heard exhorting her audience:  “If you want to eliminate their population, then be ready to kill them and be ready to go to jail. If only a 100 of us become soldiers and each of us kills 20 lakhs of them, we will be victorious…” Modi is circumspect in his speeches now, but was not always so. As chief minister of Gujarat, soon after the pogrom there in 2002 during his term that left at least 2,000 dead, mostly Muslim, he was often reported in his public speeches to evoke visions of a religious struggle of good over evil. “This is the holy place of shakti [godly power], the power for extermination of asuras [demons],” he said in one speech. “We have resolved to destroy and stamp out all forces of evil…” Beyond the goal of cleansing the Hindu land of the “cancer” to save the nation, there is another equally compelling reason for the Hindutva project to be more than just about marginalising Muslims. That has to do with the fact that India today is, in the words of historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot, “an intricate montage assembled from assorted material”, of which the Islamic is a critical element. The desire on the part of Hindutva leaders to fully realise Hindu supremacy will also require extirpating Muslim life and Muslim imprint from today’s India. Historians view the era between 1200 AD and 1750 AD (Medieval India in history textbooks) as the foundation for the highly diverse human landscape of modern South Asia, with its pluralistic culture that draws on both Indic and Islamic traditions. In their magisterial work, India Before Europe (2006), Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot show how the Central Asian ethnic heritage, Persian cultural orientation and Islamic religious affiliation of North India’s ruling elite class in the period after 1200 AD led to the dissemination of many innovative elements through the subcontinent. While acknowledging that the encounter between Indic and Islamic peoples and cultures led to short-term conflicts, Asher and Talbot note the vast degree to which cultural practices inspired by Perso-Islamic traditions became integral to the subcontinent as a whole in the long run. South Asia’s art and architecture, its political rituals, its administrative and military technologies and even its popular religions were deeply inflected by the new forms. This composite culture, the authors note, forms the basis of India that exists today, in its foods, dressing and music, languages that people speak, the built architecture, and its popular religions, among others.

Credit: Lyon, Edmund David (1825-1891)., Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons — taken from Scroll.in In the south of the peninsula, the ‘Hindu’ Vijaynagara empire (1350-1550) drew significantly from Islamicate influence in military technology, secular architecture, courtly dress, as well as local languages. The successor ‘Muslim’ sultanates of the Bahmani state in the Deccan too, followed in this tradition, most importantly in their patronage to local languages, so much so that Golconda rulers, around today’s Hyderabad, occupied an important place in the historical memory of Telengana language — with one of the sultans, Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah (1550-1580) often called Ibharama Chakravati by Telgu poets. Bijapur’s Ibrahim Adil Shah II (1580-1627), called Jagat Guru, authored a collection of songs in dakani, Kitab-e-Nauras (book of nine rasas), that opens with an invocation to Saraswati, Hindu goddess of learning, followed by praise of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and then the Chisti saint Gisu Daraz. These were no exceptions. In Bengal, the Hussain Shahi (1493-1538) rulers adopted local customs, such as purification by the water of Ganga at coronation ceremonies, and the Sufi poet, Saiyid Sultan (d 1648) published a genealogy of prophets of Islam, called Nabi Vamsha that included the Hindu god, Krishna. In Gujarat, amid the flourishing literary tradition that the Ahmad Shah rulers patronised was the Sanskrit work Raja-Vinoda (pleasure of the kings), written in honour of the ruler, Mahmud Begada (1460s), presenting the sultan as an ideal Indic king, whose court was graced by the presence of the Hindu deity Saraswati, the goddess of learning. In Malwa, in central India, capital Mandu had fine libraries that included among their collection the track Nimat-nama (c. 1500), an illustrated recipe book for making dishes suitable for all seasons, including vegetarian as well as meat-based, with illustrations drawing on both Persian and Indic tradition, including the Bhagwata Purana. However, it was the Mughals, especially Akbar (1556-1605), who helped create a state that was more Indian in character. The aesthetic that developed under Akbar’s guidance was composed of a fusion of Timurid and Indic models, and which went on to set a standard for subsequent Mughal arts and culture, including food, architecture and courtly dress and culture, Asher and Talbot argue. Besides, in the realm of built architecture, of which there is ample evidence, literary production was an important site of Indic and Islamic collaboration. Examples are the translation of Ramayana and Mahabharata in Persian (Razm-nama) and Abul Fazl’s including in his Ain-i-Akbari, extensive sections on “the learning of India” — including philosophical schools, music, life cycle rituals, and modes of image worship. The scale of the borrowing led Audrey Truschke, a prominent historian of Sanskrit at the Mughal court, to conclude that these were efforts on the part of Abul Fazl to convince Akbar’s supporters of the virtues of infusing Sanskrit knowledge into Indo-Persian thought. The tendencies towards synthesis had significant consequences. Man Singh, the highest ranking noble in Akbar’s court, only after his sons, built temples throughout the domain, including the Govinda Deva temples in Vrindavan, the largest in North India, in a recognisably Mughal style, and helped to spread Akbar’s belief in multiculturalism, just as Abdul Rahim Khaan-e-Khanan did by commissioning an illustrated Ramayana. Among the most consequential contributions of the Mughal court to Indian letters, Allison Busch shows, was its engagement with Brajbhasha. A local (Hindavi) dialect of the region around Agra and Delhi, Mughal heartlands, Brajbhasha had existed until then, mostly as bhakti devotional poetry. Under Mughal patronage, it developed a sophisticated courtly style, inspired by Sanskrit poetics, and became the principal poetic language of north India. In creating the outcome, that could be described as classical Hindi, were Akbar’s nobles composing works in the language, including Todar Mal, Birbal and the Rajput nobles, as also Faizi and Abdul Rahim Khana Khanan — showing how courtly literature in Brajbhasha was nurtured within the multicultural context of elite Mughal society. There were other enduring contributions too, of this age and milieu, outside the courtly realm. A major influence in the early part of this period was Sufis, and their dispersal, throughout much of the subcontinent. By the 14th century, the practice of Sama, devotional musical congregations, and Urs, annual pilgrimage to the shrines of Sufi saints, had become established Sufi traditions. Sufi shrines drew both Muslims and Hindus, and were themselves influenced by local traditions, including the Shattari Sufis of Bengal drawing on Nath yogis, and Rishi Sufis of Kashmir who led celibate lives and practised vegetarianism. Sufism also contributed to reform in Hindu tradition, starting in the 14th century with the rise of sants, who like Sufis, were mystics, believed in a formless God, and extolled devotion to God as a primary religious practice. Kabir, the most influential, attacked rituals and customs of traditional religions, and excoriated the caste system. Guru Nanak (born in 1469), the founder of the Sikh tradition, also came from the same context. Notably, Sufism also influenced Hindu bhakti tradition, as the historian of Indian religion John S Hawley points out. This is evident in the commonalities that the latter began to show in its focus on love for God, as did Sufis, the use of poetry and music in worship, and an ethics of compassion for others. Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas (1575), crafted in about the same age and the middle Gangetic Awadhi milieu of Sufi poets, Malik Mohammad Jayasi (Padmavat, 1540) and Mir Siyyid Manjhan (Madhumalati, 1545), exemplified this shift. Ram, an incarnation of Vishnu, became the preeminent object of devotion, in place of Siva. It is these constructions of a cosmopolitan Indian paradigm, resulting in innovations that spoke to both traditions that Hindu nationalists must disentangle and destroy to be able to achieve their vision of a Hindu supremacist India. This will undoubtedly leave much violence in its trail. These historical accounts of co-living and co-production contradict Hindutva claims that have much purchase today, in popular as well as scholarly circles about the thousand years of conflict between Muslim “outsiders” and “local” Hindus; of forced conversions and the wanton destruction of temples. Hindu nationalists have developed a wide repertoire of suffering and victimhood of Hindus at the hands of Muslims. Evidence to support their thesis is slim. Richard Eaton, one of the foremost historians of medieval India, shows how the claim that Islam spread in South Asia by the sword is incongruent with the geography of Muslim conversions in South Asia. There is an inverse relationship between the degree of Muslim political penetration and the degree of conversion to Islam, he notes. Most conversions happened in the north west and north east — Punjab and Bengal, farthest away from centres of Muslim power. As to temple destruction, Eaton found, over a span of more than five centuries from 1192 to 1729, there were “some 80 instances of temple desecration”, well short of the 60,000 claimed by Hindu nationalists. Typically, the desecrated temples would have been associated with the authority of an enemy kingdom. The instances of desecrations followed a long-established pattern in India, of temples having been natural sites for the contestation of kingly authority, well before the coming of Muslim Turks, including their destruction. Among the most recent examples was the destruction in the 10th c of the Pratihara temple of Kalapriya near Jamuna, by the Rashtrakuta king Indra III. But as the Bosnian historian, Edin Hajdarpasic, shows from his study of Balkan nationalism in the 19th century, enthusiastic depictions of suffering convey the essence of a political threat more vividly than simple facts or documentary narratives — a phenomenon he calls “authentic fantasy”. Hindu nationalists, themselves inspired by European nationalist movements at the turn of the 19th century, relied much on the construction of suffering and victimhood of Hindus, however divorced from facts. Decolonial historiography shows how they drew on the Orientalist bias of British colonial historians, who saw the period of the previous 600 years, as a history of Muslim arrival and their dominance over Hindus, marked by Muslim fanaticism, and temple destruction, forced conversion, and Hindu oppression. In contrast to the dark Muslim medieval age, colonial historians like James Mill posited the ancient Hindu age as golden, and modern British, as liberal. Hindu nationalists in power today are seeking to inflict retribution for their perceived sufferings by rewriting history. In some cases, this has taken physical forms — such as in the destruction in 1992 of the 15th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, a criminal act that was legitimised by the Supreme Court of India in 2019. Claims for several other historical mosques to be converted into temples have been set in motions across the country. Elsewhere, place names have been changed to erase any hint of their Muslim heritage. Allahabad is now Prayagraj, Mughalsarai station is Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction, Aurangabad is Sambhajinagar and Gulbarga is Kalaburagi. Not satisfied with occasional erasures, the BJP government has thought fit to change high school history and politics textbooks by significantly altering and in some cases, fully scrapping the sections on Mughal history. Credit: Yasminsheikh, CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons — taken from Scroll.in The act of political forgetting targets minorities to deprive them of history, of the right to narrate, of the capacity for recognition. History tells us it is also a precursor to violence. As eminent historians Aditya and Mridula Mukherjee noted recently, “…genocide of a community is often preceded by the community being demonised, their names changed, their history being erased”, claiming “these processes have begun in India and open calls for genocide of Muslims are being given in various parts of the country with amazing impunity”. More than Jim Crow South, the history of the Balkans in the late 19th century and post-Yugoslavia 20th century provides a better guide to understanding the future of minorities in India today. Hajdarpasic’s account of Balkan history alerts us to the real consequences of the claims of victimhood. Nationalists there used stories of suffering not only to inspire collective sacrifice but also to encourage mass violence against entire communities perceived as threats. He demonstrates how certain stories of victimisation in the region long outlived their original inspirations. Decades after overthrowing Turkish rule, Serbian nationalists could revive narratives about Turk-like enemies even in the late 20th century with catastrophic consequences. Tanika Sarkar, eminent historian of modern India, demonstrates similar impulse in early modern Hindu nationalist thought. Emblematic of this repertoire was Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s 1818 novel, Anandmath, whose main character, the Hindu sanyasi (ascetic) rebel, Satyanand, is engaged in a messianic battle “for exterminate(ing) all Muslims on this land, as they are enemies of God”, a recompense for “inflicting misfortune on Hindus”. The novel is set in the context of the 1770 famines in Bengal, as the East India Company was inserting itself at the expense of the Nawabs of Bengal, and that resulted in a third of the population starving to death, both Hindus and Muslims. Historians inform Muslim fakirs (ascetics) rose up, along with sanyasis, against the depredations. Sarkar calls for Anandmath, “the first explicit message in our literary history for ethnic cleansing”, one foretelling Hindu nationalist thoughts to emerge later in 20th century. Its protagonists deemed “elimination of Muslim rule and Muslim presence from the land” an act of worship of Bharat Maata (motherland), a deity that first emerged in the novel. In 1920, Savarkar and Golwalkar adopted Vande Mataram — hymn to Bharat Maata, contained in Anandmath — as  aHindu nationalist anthem. Vande Mataram was also the rallying cry of Hindu communalists in anti-Muslim violence to follow during Partition. Vande Mataram continues to inspire Hindu nationalist thoughts and action to this day. So when the terror-accused BJP MP Pragya Thakur recently instructed her audience to “keep your weapons sharpened”, to “in this world created by god … finish all oppressors, wrong-doers, sinners…”, she was deploying Anandmath’s template of the holy war — calling for violence against the entire Muslim population. It is in such violent contestations borne out of ‘authentic fantasies’ of past sufferings that Hindu nationalists of today — following that of Savarkar and other Hindutva ideologues — seek to create Hindu supremacy, by waging permanent war against India’s 200 or so million Muslims and other ‘foreign elements’. Already, United Nations experts are alerting us to the fact that “India risks becoming one of the world’s main generators of instability, atrocities and violence, because of the massive scale and gravity of the violations and abuses targeting mainly religious and other minorities, such as Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and others.” Mass atrocity experts are warning:  “If nothing is done to address these risks, India may continue to experience a rise in the number of violent (and fatal) attacks against religious minorities, an escalation in the scale of the violence, and an increased level of state involvement in atrocities.” The burden on Indian voters to use the ballot to forestall the institutionalisation of Hindu nationalism, before it reaches a point of no return, is therefore, even heavier.

While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders. But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well. FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone — including over interference in the PFF elections. Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a “Normalisation Committee” (NC) in 2019. It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board. But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way. One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it — Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik — is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket’s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport. This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF — even after his departure following elections for a new governing body — and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains. Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport. But is a franchise system like cricket’s PSL the best way forward? And why is an interim football administration pushing for it? FAR FROM NORMALISED On a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi’s north. There was an extravagant ceremony before the match, with fireworks aplenty.\xa0\xa0It was the opening match of the Ramazan Gold Cup. Sights like these have become few and far between in Pakistan football and the PFF had nothing to do with it. This tournament had been organised privately, with domestic football activity having become non-existent in the country. The Pakistan Premier Football League (PPFL), the country’s top-tier competition, hasn’t been held by the PFF since 2018. It’s something that has irked Pakistan’s history-making head coach Stephen Constantine. Constantine — who has been demanding that the league be restarted — wasn’t in attendance at the Naya Nazimabad Football Stadium, however. The 61-year-old Englishman was in Lahore, overseeing the national team’s preparations for its upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan. A day earlier in Lahore, Constantine was visibly irate during an interaction with reporters. Peppered with questions regarding Pakistan’s chances against Jordan — who had recently ended as runners-up in the Asian Cup — the English coach was blunt and unforgiving. Time and again, Constantine has reiterated that it is fundamentally important that Pakistan revives its league structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition. Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp. He was merely repeating himself six months on. He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year. For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league. “I just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,” he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny — disputed at several levels — carried out by the stopgap NC. “You don’t need every district to be part of the league. We had a Challenge Cup with 32 teams. Just take 16 teams from it and start the bloody league.” What Constantine doesn’t know is that the PFF’s internal problems aren’t the only impediment to the revival and resumption of the domestic league. More than a year before his appointment as the chairman of the FIFA appointed ‘Normalisation Committee’ in December 2021, Haroon Malik visited the FIFA headquarters in Zurich for a ‘secret meeting’ that would determine the future trajectory of Pakistan football. GAMING THE SYSTEM To be fair, Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 — which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA — to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all. This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country’s and clubs’ abysmal performance in international competitions. The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC. One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee’s association, remains disputed. In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote — against the PFF Constitution — in the ongoing district elections. These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF’s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections. A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community. There’s a method to the madness, however. Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations. Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo). The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president. Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women’s national championship. With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate’s favour. With clubs — that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 — set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs. The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency. In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time. Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year. To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA’s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik’s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021. In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football. Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out\nof the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. Pakistan head coach Stephen Constantine with his players during a training session at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium in Islamabad in November 2023: the Englishman has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the lack of regular domestic football in the country | White Star THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF PAKISTAN FOOTBALL On a cold December afternoon in 2019, Haroon Malik posed for a picture outside the FIFA headquarters in Zurich. “Discussing Pakistan football! Invigorating meetings, exciting times!” he captioned the picture on X, then known as Twitter. The discussions that took place in the Swiss city on that day would shape the future of Pakistan football. Plans for it had been set in motion months before. In August 2019, a month before FIFA first announced the NC for the PFF, global professional services firm KPMG had begun reaching out to people with knowledge of Pakistan football. During its initial correspondence, the KPMG Football Benchmark department said that it had started “an exciting project on football in Pakistan for a prominent client.” When discussions began, it emerged that it wanted to discuss the holding of a franchise league in Pakistan. Around that same time, a Facebook page was launched by the name of Football Club Pakistan (FCPK). Those working for the page aimed at providing football updates and were employed by media communications company Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan — the Pakistan branch of Starcom, which is headquartered in Chicago and which, in turn, is a subsidiary of global marketing and communication giants Publicis Groupe. FCPK was Malik’s first foray into Pakistan football. Some 15 months after FCPK was launched, the Canadian-Pakistani tech entrepreneur was named the chairman of the PFF Normalisation Committee, following the resignation of his predecessor Humza Khan. But it is what Malik was doing in those intervening months that made his appointment one that raises issues of conflict of interest. A FOOTBALLING CHESSBOARD Back in 2019, leading the discussions on that “exciting project on football in Pakistan” was KPMG’s former sports advisory manager, Yacine Sosse Alaoui. Alaoui has since left KPMG, joining FIFA as its business intelligence manager in September 2020. But a little over six months earlier, in February 2020, Alaoui and Andrea Sartori, the head of KPMG Football Benchmark, had accompanied Malik for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, where they met with officials from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) about what Malik called “discussing opportunities and ideas for Pakistan football.” Malik had not been named as head of the NC at that time. “Haroon Malik came to the AFC in 2020 with people from KPMG,” a source in Asian football’s governing body told Eos. “Discussions with the marketing department centred on\xa0a\xa0competition.” When\xa0the AFC was asked about that visit, a spokesperson of Asia’s football governing body termed it “a courtesy visit.” In fact, it was the December 2019 meeting in Zurich that had reportedly set up discussions with the AFC. The FIFA headquarters is a seven-storey building: two floors above ground and five underground. It was a closed-doors secret meeting on one of those levels that would script the future of Pakistan football. In alleged attendance alongside Sartori, Alaoui and Malik were Mario Gallavotti, the Italian lawyer who heads FIFA’s independent committees; Romy Gai, the chairman of London-based sports industry operators AWE International Group; and Pakistani advertising mogul Raihan Merchant. The proposal was laid out for holding a franchise league in Pakistan with Gallavotti and Gai — who would in 2022 become FIFA’s chief business officer — on board. Their interests remain unknown, but the talk in FIFA at that time was “that something big was going to happen in Pakistan football.” Sartori, Gai and Gallavotti are all Italian. When FIFA was approached for comment in 2022 regarding that meeting, its spokesperson gave a stern reply: “Please be informed that there are no updates regarding the matter you’ve mentioned.” The world football body did not comment on whether Gallavotti and Gai were part of that meeting, although they did not deny it either. Meanwhile Merchant, when contacted by Eos, denied his presence at the meeting. A source close to the discussion, however, says otherwise: “They [Gallavotti and Gai] were really pushing for the league to happen,” the source told\xa0Eos. “The purpose of the meeting seemed to push for its endorsement.” It was clear that Malik and his associates didn’t want to come out as rebels.\xa0They wanted to hold the league with the PFF’s blessings, as part of the domestic calendar, but also as sole holders of all rights for the event. Football was going to be the third sports discipline Z2C Limited — the holding company for ventures owned by Merchant, which also has Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan, now Brainchild Communications — was going to organise a league for. Malik has been an executive director at Z2C since January 2019 — a position he still holds. Merchant and Malik also are alumni of the same university. Malik’s FCPK would become the ideal social media tool to propagate the league. Meanwhile, Z2C also had BSports — a sports app that combined social and data feeds with a livestream of sports events. It also had digital rights for the Pakistan Super League. The question being raised is whether Malik’s interest is in putting the affairs of the PFF in order as head of the NC or to push forward the franchise league he is invested in. Haroon Malik’s Instagram post showing him at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on December 5, 2019, more than a year before his appointment by FIFA as the NC chairman | Instagram/roon.toon FIFA’S ROLE While giving another nine-month extension to Haroon Malik and his team till March 2024 — originally the NC had been appointed in September 2019 till June 2020, while Haroon was appointed the NC chairman in January 2021, for a nine-month period — FIFA\xa0had\xa0warned of possible sanctions being imposed if PFF elections weren’t held by then. But despite little headway being made and multiple deadlines being missed, FIFA has once again extended its mandate till December 2024. “Of course, it’s those links high up in FIFA,” one source close to the matter tells\xa0Eos. “With Haroon there, the franchise league plan stays alive.” In the meantime, most former Starcom employees are now working for the PFF, a simple LinkedIn search will show. Hasnain Haider, PFF’s head of digital media, was a project manager at Starcom. PFF’s football performance analyst, Irtaza Hussain, was community manager for FCPK at Starcom. PFF’s current creative manager, Haider Ali, was formerly at Z2C. While the NC has been unable to pay dues to players of the national teams because of an audit objection raised by FIFA, the employees continue to get paid by funds coming in from the global football body. “The PFF is effectively being run by Starcom,” a source in the NC tells\xa0Eos. “The groundwork is being laid for the franchise league they want to hold.” Malik, though, hasn’t been the only one looking to organise a football league in Pakistan. UK-based TouchSky Group, Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa football official Shahid Shinwari have all publicly stated their intentions of doing so as well. TouchSky, later rebranded as Global Soccer Ventures and now repackaged as Pakistan Football League, is set to unveil its franchise league next month. It has set a date of November 1 to hold its franchise league which, contrary to the brochures it has been sending out, does not have the endorsement of the English Premier League\xa0or\xa0its\xa0clubs. But with the PFF having the final say over any league, Haroon’s position as the NC chief, which will see him hold elections for a new executive committee of the country’s football governing body, means there is a conflict of interest, even if he says that FIFA doesn’t think there is any. “Anyone associated with football, anywhere in the world, would have some stake in the game,” Haroon told\xa0Eos\xa0in April 2021. “It is normal, and natural. You cannot have someone who knows nothing about football, nothing about the market that they are operating in, and be responsible for football. Employers determine if conflict of interests are potentially troublesome. FIFA determined that my commercial interests have no conflict with this role [as NC chief]. If FIFA is okay, then that is the final word.” In fact, FIFA did not specifically comment on Haroon’s commercial interests having a conflict with his role, but its spokesperson said that “in\xa0line with standard procedures, all members of the Normalisation Committee were subject to stringent eligibility checks.” The spokesperson did not disclose whether FIFA had knowledge of Haroon’s elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: “FIFA has no further comment at this stage.” TAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSL In 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL. Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league. But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later. Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines. With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren’t the only ones. For some time, Badar “Bobby” Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C’s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021. “They just can’t get it together,” he said. Badar has been involved in almost every sport — from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships. “Working on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],” he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL. Puyol’s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan. Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky — who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event — had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League. The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan. TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon’s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed. ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES? Haroon Malik’s and Z2C’s plans had already taken off the ground by then. Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed. And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik’s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared — thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s key advisers. But Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league — only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months. Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports. “Looking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,” Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL. “A hybrid model transitioning into promotion/relegation makes sense to me. [America’s] Major League Soccer, [Japan’s] J-League is a good conversation starter.” Malik expanded on this: “So many possibilities. Bottom line — either one is good for the players! Get them playing! Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast. Not insurmountable!” When asked why a traditional league model — which would see the country’s football club culture thrive — might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, “We are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere.” However, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies. Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football. Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions. The Major League Soccer (MLS) — a franchise league system — has achieved huge popularity in the United States. The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year. In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country’s national league. Its current season, which began in September, will culminate\xa0in\xa0May. Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their\xa0programmes. This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides. With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC’s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions. Malik, however, believes that wouldn’t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him. “Setting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,” he said during that exchange. “Once that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place.” Malik’s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast. But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration. When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate. The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process. Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik’s control of the election process and the federation. TIME TO TURN A CORNER Such control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik’s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition. If a candidate they’re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped. It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C. “Gallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA’s inner circle, closest to Infantino,” one source in the global football body tells\xa0Eos. “If they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later.” FIFA’s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence. The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC’s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history. But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country’s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable. Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country. When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan — Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC — for the event. A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan’s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand. The NC later stated that the clubs weren’t interested in participating at the SAFF event. It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations. Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one. As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA’s inner circle.

Startled you with my letter, right? And you are wondering what on earth has made me write a letter when I could have simply messaged you or called you up. And I know, fumbling with anxiety, you have checked your phone by now to see if you had missed my calls or messages. So let me assure you, everything is fine Maa, please do not fret. And keep reading this. You know, this time I wanted to do something really special for you on Mother’s Day. First, I thought of gifting you those emerald earrings you longed to have, the ones whose picture you have saved in your phone’s gallery for ages. Or buy you a pair of comfy shoes that will help you walk around, doing the household chores easily. But then I realised that these materialistic things will not reveal my love for you until I express it myself. Let me put it straight — for me, Mother’s Day is not meant to be celebrated on only one day of the year, every day is Mother’s Day.  How? Because I cannot imagine a day without your presence. The very thought of life without you makes my heart skip a beat. My day kick-starts when each morning you wake me up for the Fajr prayers and I see warmth, wisdom and love emanating from your beautiful countenance. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. On days when the worries of tomorrow overwhelm me and make it impossible for me to climb out of bed, your counseling helps me rise and muster up the strength to combat the challenges of the world. You are not only my mother, but you are also my best friend, my North Star and my greatest motivator. When the hardships of my life seem to be unbearable, it’s in your arms that I find solace. When I am all lost and unable to make a decision, your words of wisdom show me the direction and help me stay focused. When situations get tough and I am on the verge of giving up, it’s your constant reminders to remain steadfast and have strong faith in the Almighty, that prevents me from relinquishing my objectives. Above all, you are my greatest well-wisher. After scooping accolades, when I return home all elated and brimming with joy, you are the first one to embrace me and rejoice at my success. As I sit at my desk, penning down my sentiments, I can’t help recalling the love and devotion with which you have taught me when I was little. The patience and dedication with which you have coached me have not only helped me soar in my academics, but also in all the endeavours of my life. The values and morals you have instilled in me have guided me, helped me distinguish between right and wrong, and have thus shaped my entire personality. The greatest achievement for me is when people praise me for taking after you, and I am all the more grateful to Allah for blessing me with such an amazing mother. You have always been my true protector and guide, ever since my birth. How can I not recount the numerous sleepless nights you’ve spent by my bed, praying for my health whenever I have fallen ill, or the anxiousness with which you have waited for me, after school and outside the examination halls? The most incredible part is that though this little daughter of yours is now a grown-up, your love for her has not faded away, instead it has amplified. Even today, I can see the anxiousness in your eyes when I am late from work, can feel the worry in your voice when I am unable to respond to your calls, and can discern your endearment when you cook delectable food items, especially for me. Maa, you have been a saviour throughout the ebbs and flows of my life’s struggles. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. Whether I needed a shoulder to cry on or a friend to confide in, an expert to offer me advice, or a buddy to celebrate my minuscule accomplishments, Maa, you have executed all these roles, flawlessly! I know no matter how hard I try, I can never be able to repay you for the amount of sacrifices you have made for me and for the unfaltering care, support and unconditional love you have showered on me. Nevertheless, with utmost gratitude, I pray to the Almighty Allah to bless you with abundant health and happiness, today and always. Ameen Happy Mother’s Day, Maa!

According to meteorological forecasts, the precipitation in the Anhui region during this summer is expected to increase by 50 to 80 percent compared to the usual levels. The possible extreme rainfall-induced floods pose a great threat to the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute is utilizing digital tools and other technical expertise to carry out flood prevention and the maintenance of power grid equipment. On Thursday, at the inspection site of the Yungu 220 KV transformer substation in Hefei, Anhui province, maintenance personnel inspected goods and materials regarding flood prevention and uploaded related information. Technical staff members from the institute conducted statistical analysis of all units through the Anhui power grid disaster prevention platform. Those efforts provided robust support for power grid flood prevention. Power grid flood warning and prediction is a data-intensive task, and the institute is actively advancing the collection and integration of data in need. By gathering data from various sources such as the number forecast center, hydrological bureaus and meteorological departments, an intelligent algorithm system for warning of floods and geological disasters is being constructed. Through the use of data and positioning systems, disaster warnings of particular stations or lines can be achieved. Real-time risk prediction can be sent to front lines through the platform to help initiate flood prevention emergency responses, organize patrols and ensure timely access to flood information. Based on the inspection operation app, maintenance personnel can conduct inspections of low-lying substations, ground wire station buildings, foundational waterlogged poles or towers and other power grid facilities. All flood prevention risk information can be found at the disaster prevention platform. Utilizing digital methods to monitor and control the progress of risk management, they have achieved a full-process control from risk identification, to formulation of risk management plans and finally to the elimination of the risks. Additionally, based on the distribution of risks, a refined scheduling of flood prevention can be organized. Combining historical data on floods, flood-prone areas, and other relevant information, technical personnel from the institute utilized the disaster prevention platform to analyze high-risk power grid equipment in flood-prone areas. Innovative technologies such as three-eye cameras, videos and the precise monitoring of water levels within stations were employed to accurately monitor water levels. Furthermore, drone inspections and shared tower videos were utilized to achieve precise disaster monitoring across all areas at all time. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute, in line with the requirements of digital transformation in power grid flood prevention, has established a digital control system for power grid flood prevention processes. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by power grid flood prevention work in areas such as prediction, material transportation and on-site inspections during flood seasons.

The world body approved the Arab and Palestinian-sponsored resolution by a vote of 143-9 with 25 abstentions. It is Israel\'s relentless military offensive in Gaza since Oct 7 that has prompted more UN members to join the pro-Palestine group. A UN General Assembly resolution on Oct 27 calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza was approved 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Although the US can still veto Palestine\'s UN membership in the UN Security Council voting on the issue as it did on April 18, the result of the latest UN General Assembly vote reflects a wider support for full membership of Palestine in the UN, which means a greater pressure on Washington to act against the will of the world. US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood said on Friday that for the US to support Palestinian statehood, direct negotiations must guarantee Israel\'s security and future as a democratic Jewish state and that Palestinians can live in peace in a state of their own. But by saying that the US side just pretends to be blind to the fact that it is the Israeli side that has been recklessly killing the Palestinian people on their land. And even if the Hamas Oct 7 attack is taken into account, what the Israel has done in the region since the World War II must also be borne in mind as well, which clearly shows the right and wrong regarding the Palestinian question. The world can see clearly that the statehood of Israel has not only been fully guaranteed but also the country has prospered. In the process, it has continuously expanded its influences to the Palestinian side beyond the 1967 borders, and even invaded neighboring countries, including Syria and Lebanon. Over the years, Israel, as the occupying power, has technically eroded the foundation of the two-state solution. The current conflict, which has lasted for more than seven months, is more likely to completely ruin the prospects of the two-state solution agreed by the international community. So it is not the security or future of Israeli people that has become a question of grave concern, but that of the Palestinians, whose survival in Gaza has even become a question today thanks to Israel\'s aggression indulged and supported by Washington, not to mention the overdue statehood of their country. That Israel intensified its attack on Rafah on Saturday, under the US\' acquiescence, in response to the UN General Assembly the Palestine-related vote the previous day, presents a grave provocation to the common will of the international community, and also serves to put an end to its peace talks with Hamas in Cairo that has lasted for days, in which Hamas had made big concessions for a ceasefire. Israel should stop its collective punishment of the Gaza people, stop advancing its military offensive in Rafah, and effectively remove all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. In the West Bank, Israel should stop all settlement activities and effectively curb the intensifying settler violence. Palestine should enjoy the same status as Israel, and the Palestinian people should enjoy the same rights as the Israeli people. It is the common responsibility of the international community, including the US, to support and promote the process of Palestinian independent statehood and provide a strong guarantee for the implementation of the two-state solution and the realization of lasting peace in the Middle East. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the US should put aside its own interests and work for world peace and humanity, undertaking its global responsibility. The UN Security Council is a platform to resolve issues and not create divisions or hijack the global peace agenda for one\'s own narrow ends by abusing its veto power. Copyright 1995 -  .

According to meteorological forecasts, the precipitation in the Anhui region during this summer is expected to increase by 50 to 80 percent compared to the usual levels. The possible extreme rainfall-induced floods pose a great threat to the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute is utilizing digital tools and other technical expertise to carry out flood prevention and the maintenance of power grid equipment. On Thursday, at the inspection site of the Yungu 220 KV transformer substation in Hefei, Anhui province, maintenance personnel inspected goods and materials regarding flood prevention and uploaded related information. Technical staff members from the institute conducted statistical analysis of all units through the Anhui power grid disaster prevention platform. Those efforts provided robust support for power grid flood prevention. Power grid flood warning and prediction is a data-intensive task, and the institute is actively advancing the collection and integration of data in need. By gathering data from various sources such as the number forecast center, hydrological bureaus and meteorological departments, an intelligent algorithm system for warning of floods and geological disasters is being constructed. Through the use of data and positioning systems, disaster warnings of particular stations or lines can be achieved. Real-time risk prediction can be sent to front lines through the platform to help initiate flood prevention emergency responses, organize patrols and ensure timely access to flood information. Based on the inspection operation app, maintenance personnel can conduct inspections of low-lying substations, ground wire station buildings, foundational waterlogged poles or towers and other power grid facilities. All flood prevention risk information can be found at the disaster prevention platform. Utilizing digital methods to monitor and control the progress of risk management, they have achieved a full-process control from risk identification, to formulation of risk management plans and finally to the elimination of the risks. Additionally, based on the distribution of risks, a refined scheduling of flood prevention can be organized. Combining historical data on floods, flood-prone areas, and other relevant information, technical personnel from the institute utilized the disaster prevention platform to analyze high-risk power grid equipment in flood-prone areas. Innovative technologies such as three-eye cameras, videos and the precise monitoring of water levels within stations were employed to accurately monitor water levels. Furthermore, drone inspections and shared tower videos were utilized to achieve precise disaster monitoring across all areas at all time. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute, in line with the requirements of digital transformation in power grid flood prevention, has established a digital control system for power grid flood prevention processes. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by power grid flood prevention work in areas such as prediction, material transportation and on-site inspections during flood seasons. It enhanced the prediction and warning capabilities, promoted the usage of digital tools, and supports the digital transformation of the company. Copyright 1995 -  . All rights reserved.
