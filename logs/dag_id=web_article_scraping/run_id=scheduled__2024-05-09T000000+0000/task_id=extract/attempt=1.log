His family told industry publication Variety that he died on Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, California. "His films were revolutionary and iconoclastic, and captured the spirit of an age," their statement said. Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro are among the actors he helped develop. Directors James Cameron and Martin Scorsese cut their teeth on his films. Many of his films became cult classics and he became famous for the speed at which he worked, often making two films at the same location and at the same time, in order to save money. Roger Corman was born in Detroit on 5 April 1926. His father, William, was an engineer and he had intended to follow in his footsteps. However, while studying at college, he became attracted to film-making and after a spell working for General Motors quit his job and went to work at 20th Century Fox as a messenger boy. Having failed to make much progress, he set off for Europe where among other things, he briefly studied English literature at Oxford. He returned to the US with ambitions to become a screenwriter. He sold his first script, The House in the Sea, in 1953 and it was filmed as Highway Dragnet the following year with Corman being credited as co-producer. However, he was so upset by the changes made to his story that he scraped together some cash and set himself up as a producer. Corman began directing in 1955 with Swamp Women and over the next 15 years he made more than 50 films, gaining a reputation for the speed with which he could turn them out. It became something of a joke in the film industry that Corman could negotiate a contract from a public phone, shoot the film in the phone box and pay for it with the coins in the change slot. The 1960 release, The Little Shop of Horrors, which featured a brief appearance by a young Jack Nicholson, took just two days to shoot with Corman using the set of a previous film, Bucket of Blood. A stage musical based on the film opened in 1982 and would itself spawn a second film version four years later. Corman decided to widen his horizons with a series of films based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe and featuring Vincent Price as the lead in all but one of them. The House of Usher was released in 1960 and was followed by a string of others including The Raven, The Masque of the Red Death and The Tomb of Ligeia. His 1962 film, The Intruder, which examined racial tensions in America\'s Deep South, featured a young William Shatner and won an award at the Venice Film Festival. Despite this, the film flopped at the box office and became Corman\'s first film to make a loss, prompting him to remark that he\'d stick to making films that entertained rather than carried a social message. For a time he became part of the 1960s counter-culture, making biker film The Wild Angels, which starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra. He also directed The Trip, which was written by and starred Jack Nicholson. The film was seen as the precursor of Easy Rider, with both Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper featuring in the cast In the late 60s he set up his own production company, New World Pictures. As well as continuing to make budget movies, he also began handling films made by distinguished foreign film-makers, including Francois Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini and introducing them to an American audience. He sold New World Pictures in the 1980s but went on to form two more production companies. He also returned to the director\'s chair in 1990 with the film Frankenstein Unbound. Based on a Brian Aldiss novel, it starred John Hurt and Bridget Fonda and featured a brief appearance by Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the Australian band INXS. In 2009 he received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement and continued to work well into his eighties, producing the 2010 films Dinoshark and Sharktopus for the Syfy TV channel. The sheer quantity of films on which he worked is almost without precedent, as was his ability to find and nurture new talent. Many of his films have taken on cult status and few directors have been so successful at making popular pictures on such tight budgets. When asked how Corman would like to be remembered, he said, \'I was a filmmaker, just that,\'" the family said in their statement.

Price, who becomes Walesâ\x80\x99 14th world champion, achieved the feat in just her seventh professional fight in front of a passionate Cardiff crowd at the Utilita Arena. The new WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine welterweight champion, Price could be set for some huge nights ahead in a stacked division with the likes of Natasha Jonas, Sandy Ryan and Mikaela Mayer all now potential future opponents. Price, a 2020 Olympic champion, won every round on the judges\' cards after the ringside medics decided 39-year old American McCaskill could not safely continue. â\x80\x9cThis has got to be up there with winning a gold medal,â\x80\x9d Price said. â\x80\x9cJessica McCaskill is a credit to the sport, but this was my night. â\x80\x9cI want to create a legacy and I honestly believe this is just the start. It took me a couple of rounds to find my rhythm, it was a tough fightâ\x80¦ but I enjoyed myself in there tonight. â\x80\x9cI am only going to get better. I am still learning.â\x80\x9d Price, also a former kickboxing world champion and international footballer, had made clear she felt she belonged on the biggest stage after being catapulted into the limelight in just her seventh paid fight. Fighting a mere 14 miles or so from her home town of Ystrad Mynach, Price was looking to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Joe Calzaghe, Enzo Maccarinelli and current world champion Joe Cordina who have all enjoyed winning nights in the Cardiff Arena. Cordina, who has twice won world titles in the Welsh capital, had implored Price to enjoy her moment being centre stage, warning that she might never again enjoy the chance to fight in front of her home fans. Price, who fought all over the world as an amateur, had never boxed professionally in Wales and the event, broadcast live on BBC Wales as the broadcaster showed a world title fight for the first time in 19 years, had a distinctly Welsh flavour. The 29-year old entered the ring to the Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd â\x80\x93 perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with more than 50 Wales football caps - with former Welsh world champions Maccarinelli, Lee Selby, Steve Robinson and Barry Jones all in attendance at ringside. Lauren Price became world champion in just her seventh professional fight This was unquestionably the biggest night of Priceâ\x80\x99s professional career but she showed no signs of nerves as she sensibly looked to create space and distance against a fighter renowned for ploughing forward on the front foot. A cagey first session saw Price land the slightly cleaner shots, keeping her composure as she landed with a flurry of punches at the end of round two. McCaskill is a fighter who never takes a backward step but Price worked behind her jab and used her speed and movement to tag the American with a series of eye-catching shots. The Detroit fighter was warned for holding and pushing in the third round and she struggled to deal with Priceâ\x80\x99s relentless pace, with the Welsh boxer looking far more experienced than her six pro fight resume. Price and McCaskill had an accidental clash of heads in the fifth round that left huge swelling around McCaskillâ\x80\x99s left eye as the home fighter began to take control. Price, who dedicated her win to her grandmother Linda and late grandfather Derek, who raised her, says she wants to create a legacy for Welsh womenâ\x80\x99s boxing and winning her first world title is the first step. A unique athlete who wrote in a school letter aged just eight that she wanted to be a world kickboxing champion, international footballer and Olympian, Price is used to chasing her dreams and has become a world champion just 23 months after making her professional debut. The Rob McCracken-trained fighter had vowed that she would not allow McCaskill to turn the contest into a â\x80\x9cdogfightâ\x80\x9d and was true to her word as she used her superior defensive acumen and speed to dominate from start to finish. McCaskillâ\x80\x99s corner were having to work overtime to deal with the swelling above her left eye, with the American flying out of her corner in the sixth session in search of the one big punch she felt could stop the fight in an instant. However, Price was too composed to deviate from the gameplan and she continued to land the more telling blows as she continually tagged the champion on the inside before dancing out of reach. The latter rounds became far more attritional for Price with McCaskill desperately swinging haymakers as she looked for the one punch that could change the course of the fight and ensure she kept her titles. The fight was halted after Jessica McCaskill\'s eye was assessed by the ringside medic for a second time However, the damage to McCaskillâ\x80\x99s eye was too great with the ringside medic deciding at the start of round nine that McCaskill was unable to continue. â\x80\x9cBoxing has a new superstar,â\x80\x9d Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom said. Priceâ\x80\x99s trainer McCracken added that Price had done â\x80\x9cbrilliantly well,â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cis a credit to Wales". On the undercard, featherweight Rhys Edwards underlined his credentials as his undefeated record continued with a unanimous and clear points victory over experienced opponent Thomas Patrick Ward. Edwards is now 16-0 and won the WBA intercontinental title as he produced an eye-catchingly impressive display in front of his home fans. Edwardsâ\x80\x99 stablemates Kyran Jones and Kane Shepherd were also victorious, with Jones beating fellow Welshman Lewis Howells on points while Shepherd beat Ismael Ellis whose corner retired their fighter after a one-sided contest including a knockdown. There were also wins for heavyweights Moses Jolly and Hughie Fury, while Mark Jeffers knocked out Darren Johnstone in a middleweight contest, with Johnstone receiving oxygen in the ring. \'Generational talent\' Price ready to seize \'superstar\' moment \'Special athlete with a secret weapon\' - Price targets world title The Welsh boxer with enough siblings for a football team BBC Wales was given exclusive access to the Price camp in the days before the fight.

The Motorsport Ireland driver was pipped to victory by Spain\'s Jan Solans by a margin of just 3.2 seconds. McErlean, 24, was faster than Solans in a final stage shootout but came up just short of victory. "An incredible experience," said TokSport Skoda driver McErlean. "We have our first WRC2 podium, and no finer man to have beside me than James Fulton [McErlean\'s co-driver]. "Thanks to TokSport and Skoda for a great car but most of all, thank you to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy for always believing in me." McErlean, who was making his first WRC start of the season for TokSport Skoda, had swapped the lead with Solans on several occasions throughout the rally. The 24-year-old led by 0.1 seconds with two stages remaining, but Solans hit back and was fastest by 6.5 seconds on the penultimate stage. McErlean posted the fastest time on the final run by 3.2 seconds, but fell short of a first win by the same margin. Solans and McErlean had capitalised on accidents from experienced leaders Oliver Solberg and Gus Greensmith earlier in the event but, in truth, the pair showed great speed throughout the rally and were deserving of podium finishes. McErlean\'s performance was enough to finish ninth overall in the rally, which was won by the Rally1 machine of Sebastien Ogier. There was misfortune for Northern Ireland\'s William Creighton and Kris Meeke, who both retired on Saturday. Junior WRC champion Creighton restarted to finish the rally in 12th place in WRC2. Josh McErlean\'s first WRC2 podium feels like it had been a long time coming. He has long been tipped to challenge at the front, but Rally Portugal was a coming-of-age performance when he kept a cool head and highlighted blistering pace, while many more experienced rivals faltered. The switch from Hyundai to Skoda has already paid off and he starts his WRC2 in style, and his confidence will only grow from here. A lot was made of Motorsport Ireland\'s failed bid to secure a round of the World Rally Championship, due to a failure to get government funding - something the Rally Northern Ireland bid knows all too well - but its academy drivers show the island of Ireland has a lot to offer the world stage after the passing of the late, great Craig Breen. McErlean\'s podium was also a poignant moment, as the 24-year-old had been mentored by Breen, who was also navigated by Fulton before his passing. Fellow academy driver William Creighton is making good progress in the WRC2 class after taking the Junior WRC title last year, and Motorsport Ireland-backed drivers Jon Armstrong and Aoife Raftery are also impressing in the European championship.

He made the remarks at a pre-budget conference in Lahore, two days after  Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government would limit its business only to strategic and essential SOEs under its domain but their number would be reduced from 40 after scrutiny. Chairing the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) meeting, which was attended by the finance minister, Dar said privatisation of loss-making SOEs would be a priority. The meeting noted that 40 SOEs were currently categorised as strategic or essential, but respective ministries would submit their details to the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOE). The CCoSOE will determine the status of the SOEs to be categorised as strategic or essential entities. Speaking on Sunday, Aurangzeb said: “There is no such as [a] strategic SOE.” Talking about the meeting chaired by Dar on Friday, he continued, “We are absolutely on the same wavelength — that there is no such thing as a strategic SOE.” The finance minister said that a meeting would be held tomorrow where “we will go back to various ministries and say that all this should be handed over to the private sector”. “There will be public-private partnership and we will accelerate the privatisation agenda,” he said. Commenting on concerns regarding the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Aurangzeb said the government was not just looking at foreign investors. “They are local and foreign investors who are bidding […] there is no such thing that we are only looking at foreign investors,” he said. Commenting on a fresh loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, he said that a larger and longer programme was needed to bring “permanence in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms”. He also talked about energy reforms, saying that there were “leakages” and stressed the need for stopping theft. He said that changes were being brought to the boards of distribution companies (Discos) in order to bring in those from the private sector for “better corporate governance”. “And then you will see how we bring those Discos towards concessions or privatisation or a combination of both,” he emphasised.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Esther Perez Ruiz, the Fund’s resident representative for Pakistan, said: “A mission team led by Nathan Porter, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan, will meet with authorities next week to discuss the next phase of engagement. “The aim is to lay the foundation for better governance and stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economic growth that will benefit all Pakistanis,” she added. Pakistan last month completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but the government has stressed the need for a fresh, longer-term programme. Last week, the Fund said that a mission was expected to visit Pakistan this month to “discuss the FY25 budget, policies, and reforms under a potential new programme for the welfare of all Pakistanis”. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the $350bn economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. On Friday, the Fund said that downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the IMF in its staff report following the second and final review under the standby agreement. The Fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements. Additional input from Reuters Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.

As he met players of the men’s national team in the Irish capital of Dublin, the PCB quoted him as saying: “Fight till the last ball; the competition should be apparent.” On Friday, Ireland recorded their maiden T20 win against Pakistan who could not defend a solid-looking 182-5 after being put in to bat first, dealing a shocking blow to the Babar Azam-led side’s preparations for the World Cup, which is taking place next month in the United States. The loss to Ireland, who are in Pakistan’s group in the T20 World Cup, came after a series draw on home soil to a New Zealand squad missing most of their first-choice players. With Babar only recently reinstated as captain, it was another bump in the road for their tournament preparation. Today’s match will start at 7pm, with Ireland leading the series by 1-0. In a post on X, the PCB shared a video of Naqvi meeting the Green Shirts and speaking to them, adding that a detailed discussion on the action plan took place during the two-hour-long meetup. Encouraging the team, the PCB chairman urged the players to play with hard work, passion and a “professional approach”. He noted that T20 cricket needed a unique and aggressive approach, adding that victory was only possible if cricket was played in a “modern manner”. “An action plan can be formulated while sitting in a room but the real test is on the ground, where the performance should be visible,” the PCB quoted him as telling the team. Naqvi praised all players as “undoubtedly talented, professional and the best”, adding that the team’s bowling attack was “splendid”. However, he emphasised that great attention was required when fielding so that the opponent “cannot get any chance” to score. “The players are the hope for Pakistan and you have to meet the nation’s expectations. Teamwork is the fundamental thing for victory,” the PCB chairman said. He noted that the public loved cricket and had expectations from the team. Naqvi said that success would come if all 11 of the players in the team performed with unity. “No one is accepting the loss in the first match against Ireland. The real test after Ireland and England is the World Cup,” he added. Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said Israeli airstrikes pounded parts of northern, central and southern Gaza during the night and into Sunday morning. In Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city which sits on the Egyptian border, the Kuwaiti hospital said on Sunday it had received the bodies of “18 martyrs” killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported at least two fatalities, a father and son, both doctors, in a strike on Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Mourners react next to the body of a Palestinian killed in Israeli strikes at Al-Aqsa hospital, in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip on May 12. — Reuters A full-scale Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah “cannot take place”, the UN human rights chief insisted, saying it could not be reconciled with international law, AFP reports. “The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!” Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement. “These exhausted, famished people, many of whom have been displaced many times already, have no good options. He said a full-scale offensive could have a “catastrophic impact […] including the possibility of further atrocity crimes.” “I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.” Volker said he was deeply distressed by fast-deteriorating conditions in Gaza, saying the latest evacuation orders had triggered “massive displacement of an already profoundly traumatised population”. He said the towns supposed to receive those displaced from Rafah had already been “reduced to rubble”. Turk also voiced concern at reports of indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza.\nHe said a full-scale offensive on Rafah “cannot take place” and called on all states with influence to do everything in their power to prevent it. He also called on Israel and Palestinian armed groups to agree on a ceasefire, and for all hostages to be released immediately. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned Israel against expanding its military operations to Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “We consider an offensive on Rafah […] to be irresponsible,” Scholz said on a talk show organised by the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group in Potsdam just outside Berlin. “We warn against this, and we do not believe that there is any concept that will ultimately lead to this happening without incredible human losses in terms of innocent civilians,” he said. The German chancellor added that humanitarian aid must also be brought to Gaza, and there must be a perspective for peaceful coexistence in which two states can exist side by side. The health ministry in Gaza said that at least 35,034 people have been killed in the territory during more than seven months of Israeli bombardment, AFP reports. The toll includes at least 63 deaths over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,755 people have been wounded in the Gaza Strip since October 7. Months after Israel said it had dismantled Hamas’ command structure in northern Gaza — devastated by intense violence in the early stages of the offensive — fighting has resumed in recent days in Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City’s Zeitun neighbourhood. AFP correspondents reported intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters in the Zeitun area early on Sunday, with medics and witnesses saying troops were engaged in combat in Zeitun as well as Jabalia. A displaced Palestinian woman, who fled Jabalia after the Israeli military called on residents to evacuate, carries her belongings on her head as she makes her way towards Gaza City on May 12. — Reuters Britain’s foreign minister David Cameron has said Israel should not carry out an offensive in the Gazan city of Rafah without a “clear plan” to protect people, AFP reports. “For there to be a major offensive in Rafah, there would have to be an absolutely clear plan about how you save lives, how you move people out the way, how you make sure they’re fed, you make sure that they have medicine and shelter and everything,” he told Sky News television. “We have seen no such plan … so we don’t support an offensive in that way,” he added. Cameron said Israel needed to “do better” in allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. “I’ve said many times that I’m not content with the action Israel has taken over humanitarian aid,” he said, adding there are “some signs” of improvement, “but not fast enough”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged an immediate halt to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, the return of hostages and a “surge” in humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “I repeat my call, the world’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages and an immediate surge in humanitarian aid,” Guterres said in a video address to an international donors’ conference in Kuwait. “But a ceasefire will only be the start. It will be a long road back from the devastation and trauma of this war”, he added. “The war in Gaza is causing horrific human suffering, devastating lives, tearing families apart and rendering huge numbers of people homeless, hungry and traumatised,” Guterres said. His remarks were played at the opening of the conference in Kuwait organised by the International Islamic Charitable Organisation (IICO) and the UN’s humanitarian coordination organisation OCHA. In the course of the past 24 hours, there is clear pressure being exerted by the Israeli military on three fronts inside the Gaza Strip, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reports from Deir Al Balah. They have been maximising pressure on Rafah, the middle area as well as the north of the territory, he says, highlighting that the Israeli military has passed an evacuation order for residents of the Jabalia refugee camp and in the central areas of Rafah. The Israeli military has started to intensify the bombardment of the Jabalia camp in the past couple of hours, destroying residential houses and attacking evacuation centres, the report said. They say they are trying to completely eliminate Hamas battalions there despite a previous announcement that said they had managed to take military control in the north of this Strip, it added. Smoke billows during Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip from a position in southern Israel on May 12. — AFP Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram has asserted that the adoption of a resolution advocating Palestine’s full membership in the United Nations by a large majority would ramp up political pressure on the United States to reassess its position within the Security Council. The UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on Friday with 143 votes. The US and eight other countries voted against the resolution, while 25 abstained. Three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — China, France, and Russia — voted for the resolution. Britain abstained. Among US allies, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Spain, and Mexico voted for the resolution, while Germany and Canada abstained. All South Asian nations — Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan — voted in favour. Almost all Arab and other Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, also voted for the resolution. Read more here. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Imad Abu Zayda, an emergency doctor in Gaza’s Jabalia, said: “No light due to the lack of fuel and there’s no medical supplement available as Israel has expanded their operation in the area. We have no oxygen to give to patients. “Most of the injuries are children and women. We are operating with minimum facilities,” the doctor added. Israel has launched strikes on Gaza after it expanded an evacuation order for Rafah, with AFP correspondents reporting intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters near Gaza City. Witnesses said Israel had carried out strikes in Rafah near the crossing with Egypt on Saturday, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Residents piled water tanks, mattresses and other belongings onto vehicles and prepared to flee again. Residents were told to go to the “humanitarian zone” of Al-Mawasi, on the coast northwest of Rafah. “We don’t know where to go,” said Farid Abu Eida, who was preparing to leave Rafah, having already been displaced there from Gaza City. “There is no place left in Gaza that is safe or not overcrowded… There’s nowhere we can go.” Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said “we have eliminated dozens of terrorists in eastern Rafah” and the army claimed troops were fighting “armed terrorists” at the crossing and had found “numerous underground tunnel shafts”. Gaza’s civil defence agency has said that two doctors were killed in an Israeli air strike on the city of Deir Al Balah in a central area of the Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “The bodies of Doctor Muhammad Nimr Qazaat and his son, Doctor Youssef, were recovered (as they were killed) because of an Israeli raid on the city of Deir Al Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and they were transferred to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah,” the agency said in a statement. The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Music fans who gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday to watch the Eurovision contest decried juries’ snubs of Israel as “obviously political”, AFP reports. The mood was electric at the packed Layla bar in Tel Aviv as the show got underway, with the crowd going wild when Israel’s contestant Eden Golan appeared on screen. As votes started ticking in, and it became clear that few of the juries representing the 37 countries with voting rights were offering Golan even a handful of votes, spirits fell. Fans went from jumping around and waving Israeli flags to sitting downcast, some with their heads in their hands. “This is clearly political,” said Guy, a 20-year-old who declined to give his last name. “Eden was amazing… But there are people who hate us. They don’t see the whole picture,” he told AFP. “We didn’t get much from the countries. That’s obviously a political thing,” Layla manager Tal Shur agreed. Switzerland’s Nemo has won the Eurovision Song Contest, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel’s participation during the conflict in Gaza, AFP reports. Twenty-four-year-old Nemo’s “The Code” won the highest score from nations’ juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden’s Malmo. “I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world,” a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy. Nemo, Baby Lasagna and Israel’s contestant Eden Golan, had been bookmaker favourites to win the competition, watched around the world by millions of lovers of pop music — and kitschy shows. When Golan went on stage to perform her “Hurricane”, both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena. Boos could also be heard while Israel delivered its points to other acts and any time a country gave “Hurricane” high scores. Golan finished fifth with 375 points. This year’s winner Nemo, representing Switzerland, speaks during a press conference after the final of the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) at Malmö Arena, in Malmö, Sweden on May 12. — AFP Israel has hit parts of Gaza including Rafah where it expanded an evacuation order, as the UN warned an outright invasion of the crowded city risked an “epic” disaster, AFP reports. AFP journalists, medics and witnesses reported strikes across the coastal territory, where the UN says humanitarian relief is blocked after Israeli troops defied international opposition and entered eastern Rafah this week. That effectively shut a key aid crossing and suspended traffic through another. At least 21 people were killed during strikes in central Gaza and taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah city, a hospital statement said. Bodies covered in white dust lay on the ground in a courtyard of the facility. A man in a baseball cap leaned over one body bag, clasping a dust-covered hand that protruded. The feet of another corpse poked from under a blanket bearing the picture of a large teddy bear. In Rafah, witnesses reported intense air strikes near the crossing with Egypt, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Other strikes occurred in north Gaza, witnesses said. Hamas has accused Israel of “expanding the incursion into Rafah to include new areas in the centre and the west of the city”. A woman sits next to belongings, as Palestinians prepare to evacuate, after Israeli forces launched a ground and air operation in the eastern part of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on May 11. — Reuters Israel’s military has said that a new field hospital has been established in the central Gaza Strip and is being run by a non-governmental organisation, the International Medical Corp, Reuters reports. “The field hospital will be operated by 150 international medical aid workers and its dozens of beds can be used for emergency and routine medical treatment,” the military said in a statement. The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees has released images of heavily damaged or destroyed schools it runs in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where many Palestinians have been forcibly displaced after the Israeli invasion of Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “The classrooms are torched. Walls are blown out. There is rubble everywhere,” it said, adding there is no real safety or shelter at these schools. “This situation is unfolding under the world’s watch. Enough is enough.” Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the entry of aid into Gaza from the Rafah crossing due to Israel’s “unacceptable escalation”, Egypt’s state-affiliated Alqahera News satellite TV has reported, citing a senior official. Reuters reports the official also said that Egypt held Israel responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the Gaza Strip. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has discussed the dire situation in Gaza with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, with the officials agreeing that a full-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah would have catastrophic consequences and must be prevented, Al Jazeera reports quoting UN read-out. Guterres expressed “deep appreciation for Qatar’s continued mediation efforts to broker a deal for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza and the immediate release of hostages”, the statement added. The Israeli army has said rockets were launched from Rafah in southern Gaza towards the Kerem Shalom crossing, which was temporarily shut earlier this week after deadly fire, AFP reports. “Four launches were identified that crossed from the Rafah area”, the military said in a statement, adding that one rocket was intercepted by Israeli air defences “and the rest fell in open areas” around Kerem Shalom. It added that “no injuries were reported.” Weeks after attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration, Egyptian-American student Layla Sayed received a text message from a friend drawing her attention to a website dedicated to exposing people it says promote hatred of Jews and Israel. “I think they found you from the protest,” the friend wrote. When Sayed visited the site, called Canary Mission, she found a photo from the October 16 rally at the University of Pennsylvania with red arrows pointing to her among the demonstrators. The post included her name, the two cities she lives in, details about her studies and links to her social media accounts. Read more from Reuters here. Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, has released a video of a man held hostage in Gaza and seen alive in the footage, AFP reports. The man is seen speaking in the 11-second clip, which is superimposed with text in Arabic and Hebrew that reads: “Time is running out. Your government is lying”. The health ministry in Gaza has said that at least 34,971 people have been killed in the Palestinian enclave during Israel’s military bombardment in Gaza, AFP reports. The tally includes at least 28 deaths in the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,641 people have been wounded since fighting broke out on October 7. Saheb al-Hams, a hospital director in Rafah, has said that “sadly” the Kuwaiti Specialty Hospital in Rafah city “is now included in the places threatened with evacuation” following Israel’s latest order, Al Jazeera reports. “There is no other place for patients and injured people to go to but this hospital,” al-Hams said in a video message to journalists. The director called for “immediate international protection” for the medical facility. Palestinian Ambassador to the UK Husam Zomlot expressed his appreciation for Harvard students renaming a building after one of his relatives. His wife’s cousin Sidra Hassoun is “one of 14,500 children murdered in Israel’s genocide in Gaza.” In a post on X, he added that he is “proud of these students and all students everywhere” for supporting the Palestinian cause.', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Canada arrests fourth Indian national in killing of Sikh activist - World - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'A fourth Indian national was charged by Canadian authorities on Saturday in the 2023 killing of a separatist Sikh leader in Vancouver. Amandeep Singh, 22, was already being held for unrelated gun charges before being charged with “first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder” in the slaying of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Three other Indian nationals were arrested this month. The killing sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau linked Indian intelligence to the killing. Nijjar — who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 — had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged “terrorism” and conspiracy to commit murder — allegations he denied. He was shot dead on June 18, 2023, by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver. Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had “credible allegations” connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying. India dismissed the allegations as “absurd” and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning. The shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China’s growing influence. US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India’s top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported in April.

Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

All these men served as judges in the country’s high courts and the apex court before they retired to re-join the legal fraternity as seasoned practitioners of the law. For each of my requests, I receive either “excuse me”, or “sorry”. Finally, one of them agrees to talk — but not openly. “Please don’t mention my name,” says the retired Sindh High Court judge as our conversation ends. “You may write each and every word I have shared with you but not my name. I would prefer to be an anonymous source. One never knows here what can happen the next day: it’s better to stay away from even the memories of such controversial events.” The ordeal he recalls of that bloody Saturday refreshes the grim memories of the city being under siege for nearly 24 hours, held hostage by forces in the face of whom even jurists and law-enforcers were helpless. Two rival rallies had been planned that day — one by the legal fraternity, backed by parties then in the opposition, to welcome into the city the then deposed chief justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, and the other organised by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), favoured by the then military dictator General Pervez Musharraf, in protest against the “politicisation” of the issue of the presidential reference against Mr Chaudhry. A certain level of fear had prevailed, but no one could have guessed the deeply disturbing events that were to follow — certainly not the then serving high court judge. “I was travelling with my driver and armed guard to the Sindh High Court where the chief justice had to deliver an address when we were forced to stop near Sir Syed Girls College in Nazimabad,” he says. Armed motorcyclists surrounded his official, flag-bearing car, pulled out his driver and switched off its engine, seizing the keys. The bikers then bludgeoned the stationary car several times, so hard that its bumper fell off. In one of the busiest and most densely populated city neighbourhoods, a serving judge sat in fear. “I talked to them,” he says. “They were obviously aware that I was a high court judge. After debate and argument, they allowed me to leave but I reminded them that I couldn’t because keys of my car had been snatched by one of them.” Finally, the key was returned and the judge was ‘allowed’ to leave. As he got back into his car, the men surrounding him came up with their last strike: they stripped his car of the national flag. At the nearest police station of Pak Colony, he waited for nearly two hours for police security to arrive, as promised by the Governor’s House after it was informed about the episode. “Then came an SSP-ranking officer with his team to escort me,” he says. “The police left us some two kilometres from the Singh High Court building, saying that they could no longer help us. My driver parked the car at a safer place. Then, with my driver and guard, I walked to the high court to find all entrances blocked. Finally, I jumped over one of the walls to enter the building.” If this was the experience of a high court judge, one can only imagine the situation for political workers. In anticipation of the two rallies, law enforcers had been put on high alert the day before. The fire brigade had been directed to remain on standby and hospitals were asked to ready themselves. But the next day, hapless citizens found that the city had been abandoned by the law-enforcement agencies, and armed youths were wandering at will. Nasir Khan, one of the Awami National Party workers, witnessed a few of them at Malir Halt. I meet Nasir almost at the same spot where he narrowly escaped death. “As our rally from Quaidabad reached here [Malir Halt], it came under fire,” he says. “I miraculously remained unhurt but I watched two of my friends die from bullet wounds and several others fell injured. It was a terrible experience and even today I shiver while recalling that day.” After 10 years, only eyewitness accounts of the May 12 events remain. Justice and any action on the part of the state are still awaited. “Should we call ourselves humanity when the fallen remain un-avenged a year to a day since that fateful day in May?” wrote Justice Qazi Faez Isa, a Supreme Court judge and former chief justice of the Balochistan High Court, in this paper in 2008. Years later, the question remains pertinent. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2017 Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd. (www.compunode.com).Designed for Dawn. Copyright © 2024, Dawn NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Indian elections - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'THE Islamophobic rhetoric being employed by Narendra Modi for this election campaign has become shrill. Pakistan has nearly always been an electoral issue in India. However, this time, it is Indian Muslims who are bearing the brunt of the Indian prime minister’s hate speech. Speaking in Rajasthan last month, he called Muslims “infiltrators” and said they produce too many children. In Gujarat, where, as chief minister, he had overseen the massacre of Muslims in 2002, he accused the Congress of seeking to “loot” India’s wealth and redistribute it among Muslims, and of organising a ‘vote jihad’ against his leadership. Later, he accused the Congress and Muslims of stealing Hindu wealth and property. Modi’s inflammatory rhetoric was followed by the BJP’s campaign video portraying Muslims as outsiders who plundered India’s wealth. As concerns grew about communal violence, the video was removed. These allegations are a sequel to Modi’s public referencing of earlier conspiracy theories of ‘love jihad’ (Muslims forcibly converting Hindu women and marrying them to increase the Muslim population) or ‘land jihad’ (capturing land to construct religious structures and gaining control of India’s territory). Concerns that his rhetoric might incite further violence against Indian Muslims are increasing. Ordinarily, since Hindus are in a majority in India, it may be difficult to question the rationale of creating a Hindu state. However, two observations are in order. One, the expansionist designs of the cherished Hindu state seek the creation of an Akhand Bharat, a Hindu right fantasy, which would violate the territorial integrity of Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, as per a map displayed in the new parliament building. This is not acceptable to the aforementioned independent states. Two, though the creation of a Hindu state should not translate into discrimination against minorities, regrettably this will be the case. The works of French political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot illustrate how Muslims, 14.5 per cent of India’s population, are grossly underrepresented in bureaucracy, the judiciary, police, and legislative organs. They are second-class citizens. The Muslim-majority area of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmiri is also being subjected to demographic engineering. The destruction of the centuries-old Babri Masjid by Hindu zealots in 1992 and the construction of a temple in its place has set a precedent that might be followed for other historic mosques. This contrasts sharply with the UAE’s gesture of permitting a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. Modi’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is raising concerns of violence. Analysts are also pointing out the fascist tendencies of the BJP regime, a steep decline in democratic values, and a departure from the moorings of pluralism and secularism on which modern India was founded. In her book The Incarcerations, Alpa Shah contends that Modi’s India is using its national security apparatus to incarcerate ordinary citizens for their dissenting views. Commenting on the book, Arundhati Roy stated that this was about criminalisation and incarceration of dissent itself. Strikingly, the Modi regime has also used art and culture to project the Hindutva philosophy. Kunal Purohit’s book H-Pop: The Secretive World of Hindutva Pop Stars shows how Hindutva pop stars and influencers are being used to spread the message of Hindu supremacy and create acceptance of Hindutva’s core beliefs. Apart from this, Modi is playing on his government’s accomplishments: making India the world’s fifth largest economy; the construction of 50,000 kilometres of national highways; boosting India’s mi\xad\xadlitary spending; bu\xad\xadilding Vikrant, In\xad\xaddia’s first domes\xadti\xad\xadcal\xad\xadly built aircraft carrier; and the Chandrayaan-3 moon landing. His prospects of winning a third term have been bolstered by a weak opposition. Despite the formation of the Congress-led 37-party INDIA coalition, there is no real challenge. What has bolstered his outreach is India’s enhanced global standing. In his book Why Bharat Matters, S. Jaishankar presents India as a leader of the global south and makes a case for the rejuvenation of India as a civilisational state. There are some lessons that Pakistan could learn from India’s electoral process. One, despite the large scale of India’s elections (969 million registered voters; 1m polling stations) and the use of electronic voting machines, election results are largely accepted without much ado. Two, there is no caretaker government, as the incumbents become ‘caretakers’ in a way, and refrain from announcing major policy decisions or sanctioning expenditure for development schemes. If Modi wins a third term, he is likely to maintain his pro-Hindutva, anti-Muslim, and hegemonic attitude towards regional countries, particularly Pakistan.

Children in the classrooms are busy making greeting cards, drawing pictures of themselves and the only woman whom they have come to know as their mother, their Chhoti (younger) Mummy Sabah Faisal Edhi. The duties of the busy mother of so many children, including four of her own, starts from early morning. After tending to her own household duties and sending off her youngest, Moosa Edhi, to school, she is in the nursery at 8am sharp, inquiring from the staff there if everyone had a good sleep, if anyone had any issues during the night. It has become a habit with her to visit the nursery first to inquire about her babies before getting to her other work of calling up the other Edhi Homes and Centres, asking about the other children, their health and school progress, asking about the women in their Homes, tending to the marriage proposals, and adoption procedures and planning outings and picnics for the children. When parents discover their babies are ‘not well’, they quietly leave them in our cot, says Sabah Edhi as country celebrates Mother’s Day today But today, before she can go inside the nursery, she stops in the playroom to admire three-year-old Fatima’s greeting her with a broad smile and a happy dance. Chhoti Mummy hugs the child and gestures to know if she has eaten breakfast. Fatima is deaf and mute. She has only recently been fitted with a cochlear implant, which has enabled her to hear and appreciate music to which she loves to dance. It is quite obvious that Sabah’s favourite in the nursery is five-year-old Moosa, named by Mummy, Bilquis Edhi, herself, after her own youngest grandson, Sabah and Faisal’s youngest son Moosa. But this Moosa, even though he is five, doesn’t look more than a year old. His growth is stunted. Sabah lifts him out of his cot and cuddles him lovingly. The nursery only has special children or children with learning disabilities. Moosa was the last child here named by Bilquis Edhi. The rest have been given names by their Chhoti Mummy. There are two newborn baby girls, Aimen and Noor Fatima, peacefully sleeping in their cradles in the cheerful blue nursery. Both the babies are blind. “The moment some parents discover that all is not well with their babies they quietly leave them in our cot,” says Sabah. “They never return for them,” she sighs. “Parents of very sick children, too, disown them even when they know that their child doesn’t have much time to live. We take them in, find them the best of medical care till the last of their breath,” she adds. “On discovering a child in the cot, we first try to get information about who left him or her there followed by a thorough medical check-up. If they are in need of medical care, we make sure that they receive the best that there is. Just the other day, someone left a little girl suffering from diarrhoea. She had to be hospitalised,” she informs. Just then one little girl, of about four years of age, who also looks like she is considerably attached to her Chhoti Mummy walks in and runs up to her. “She is normal. There is nothing wrong with this one,” Sabah says. “She says her name is Manahil. We found her near Sohrab Goth. Most of the children in our Sohrab Goth Centre are much older so I brought her here with me until we can find her parents,” she informs. “By the grace of God, there is no shortage of space, love and care in this Home built for these children by Edhi Sahab and Mummy,” she says, kissing the child’s head. “All children are a blessing, a priceless gift from God. I wish the parents who discard their children like or neglect them would realise this. I wish such parents could love their special, disabled or sick children like they love their normal children,” she says. “Sometimes, these very children who they love so much because they are normal and healthy grow up to discard their parents when they are old and weak. That’s the story of so many old people in our homes,” she concludes. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2024 Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.

The parents of the deceased boy were shocked and fainted at Skardu airport when they came to know that their son’s body had been left behind in Islamabad. Mujtaba, a resident of Katshi village of Kharmang district, was diagnosed with a tumour at a hospital in Skardu and doctors referred him to Rawalpindi for treatment a month ago. His father Muhammad Askari and mother took him to Rawalpindi and he had been under treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital for weeks. Mujtaba lost his life in the hospital on Thursday. The parents decided to transport the body of their child to their native village of Katshi for burial, through a PIA flight on Friday, as a 24-hour-long journey from Islamabad to Skardu by road with the body was not possible due to hot weather. Shocked parents, relatives protest against airline management’s negligence at Skardu airport The deceased boy’s parents and another relative confirmed their tickets at flight PK-451 from Islamabad to Skardu on Friday morning. They brought the body to Islamabad airport at 6am and completed cargo procedure for the body after fulfilling SOPs and airline’s rules and made the payment. Ibrahim Asadi, a relative of the deceased boy, told Dawn that the body was scheduled to be transported with the parents to Skardu from Islamabad at 9am. He said the flight was delayed for four hours and left Islamabad at 1pm. Upon arrival at Skardu airport at 2pm, the parents were informed that mistakenly the body was not loaded on the plane and left behind at Islamabad airport. The news sparked grief and outrage as parents were shocked and started crying while the boy’s mother and father fainted at the airport. The relatives of the boy waiting to receive the body also gathered at the airport’s lounge and started protest against the PIA management’s negligence. It continued for three hours. Officials of PIA, Civil Aviation Authority and other departments, who were on duty at Skardu airport, tried to calm down the boy’s parents and relatives and admitted their mistake. They assured the parents of bringing back the body on Saturday (today). The PIA officials said the company, which handles cargos at the airport, is responsible for not loading the body and assured the parents that action would be taken against it for negligence. The boy’s parents and relatives chanted slogans against the PIA administration. They said the poor family had paid higher price to transport the body through the PIA flight, but the airline committed a serious negligence. They appealed to the government to take action against those responsible for the negligence. Yousaf Kamal, another relative of the deceased boy, said the body had deliberately not been loaded on the plane. He said Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engr Amir Muqam was scheduled to fly to Gilgit from Islamabad on Friday, adding that the PIA flight from Islamabad to Gilgit couldn’t operate due to the bad weather condition. He said the federal minister had changed his plan and decided to go to Skardu and kept the passengers waiting. He said the flight was scheduled to depart from Islamabad at 9am, but was delayed till 1pm to accommodate the minister, leaving the body behind at the airport.

An IMF mission is expected to visit the country this month to discuss a new programme, ahead of the government beginning its annual budget-making process for the next financial year. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the fund in its staff report following the second and final review under the SBA. The fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements. Last month, the country completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stressed the need for a fresh, longer term programme. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust.

Copyright © 2024, Dawn NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'The lethal troika - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'MANY factors were responsible for the defeat of the erstwhile Soviet Union and then the US in Afghanistan. A common factor was the existence of a combination of extremely resilient militant groups resisting both superpowers. This combination consisted of three categories of militants: local Afghan militants resisting foreign invaders; Pakistani militants crossing over to help their Afghan brethren; and thousands of mujahideen from various countries, particularly in the Middle East, participating in the Afghan jihad. With some variations in their composition, role and external supporters, they fought together against the US and USSR for 30 years, forcing them to withdraw. Alarmingly, after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, this Afghanistan-based lethal troika now targets Pakistan. The situation necessitates a fundamental shift in the terrorist threat assessment in Pakistan — from focusing exclusively on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan to broadening the threat calculus to the troika of the TTP, Afghan Taliban, and Al Qaeda. Concerning the nexus between the Taliban and TTP, the latest UN report on Afghanistan states that the Afghan government was supplying weapons, training facilities and regular financial packages to the TTP. Al Qaeda’s primary goal, after lying low in the region for many years, is to revive itself without annoying its Afghan hosts or attracting the West’s adverse attention. In view of this, it seems to have opted to carry out its activities in Pakistan through the TTP, while staying below the international radar. The importance Al Qaeda gives to the TTP is evident in that it selected 15 of its commanders to assist the group conduct terrorist attacks in Pakistan. It also supplied armed fighters to the TTP in its attack in Chitral in September 2023, which killed four security officials. Al Qaeda’s camp in Kunar, headed by Hakim ul Masri, is responsible for training suicide bombers for the TTP. The TTP, which has been the most lethal terrorist group in Pakistan over the last three years, is on the same page with the Taliban and Al Qaeda not only because of an ideological affinity and a shared history of fighting foreign invaders in Afghanistan, but also due to similar goals of Sharia enforcement in Pakistan. The TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. There were reports of the TTP helping the other two members of the troika by killing Taliban members defecting to the rival Islamic State-Khorasan Province in Afghanistan. The basic point is that while the troika is united on targeting Pakistan, the members play different roles. The Taliban are likely to help TTP discreetly in Afghanistan by providing sanctuary, with Al Qaeda supporting both openly in Afghanistan through mentoring and in Pakistan through its sympathisers. With its edge, the TTP is likely to carry out ground attacks in Pakistan and lead a campaign to build up its narrative of violent extremism. As far as the strategy and tactics to be adopted by the troika go, the TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. In a recent interview to Khorasan Diary, TTP ameer Noor Wali Mehsud stated, “our jihad in Pakistan … has entered a decisive phase”. He went on to say ominously: “Pakistani security agencies have unjustly occupied our homeland” and “our goal is to liberate our homeland and implement the divine law”. In a nutshell, the TTP seems to be falling back on the two-point narrative of resistance in Afghanistan, ie, ‘liberation of homeland’ and ‘enforcement of divine laws’. This brings us to the likely impact of the troika on the terrorist threat landscape in Pakistan. Since 2021, the number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan has been consistently increasing every year. This is likely to continue in 2024, with three possible changes. One, the number of Afghan nationals taking part in terrorist attacks in Pakistan may increase — we recall here the suicide bombing against military personnel in 2023 in Bannu by Afghans. Two, given its penchant for high-profile attacks, Al Qaeda may train the TTP to carry out such attacks. Three, given that the top Al Qaeda and Taliban instructors will train TTP members, the quality and sophistication of the attacks in 2024 are likely to be enhanced. Another area likely to be impacted by the troika is infiltration. Earlier, in the 1990s, Al Qaeda infiltrated educational institutions such as Karachi and Punjab universities to recruit educated youth. These recruitment cells in universities may be reactivated. Also, to stay abreast of latest government planning in counterterrorism, the TTP, like the Taliban did in Afghanistan, may attempt to infiltrate government departments, including intel agencies. The third and most important dimension of infiltration is that of the military, which was carried out by Al Qaeda in Pakistan in the late 1990s. It may be pertinent to mention that the last attempted terrorist attack by Al Qaeda was in 2014 in Karachi, when a group of naval officers tried to hijack a navy frigate and crash into a US ship in the open seas. Al Qaeda worked somewhat openly in Pakistan from the 1980s to 2001, and built up an elaborate network of civilian volunteers in many cities of Pakistan, who assisted in collecting funds, recruiting volunteers, and providing hideouts for the group. These sleeper cells might again be contacted by it and reactivated. Similarly, there were some Pakistani militant organisations of the 1980s, like the Harkatul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, etc, sympathetic to Al Qaeda and lying low these days. Al Qaeda may re-establish contact with them and get their support for the TTP. Finally, both the Taliban and Al Qaeda are known for their high-quality propaganda campaign. The TTP media wing lacks that finesse. In the light of guidance from the Taliban and Al Qaeda, we are likely to witness a significant improvement in the quality of propaganda. As Sun Tsu stated, “if you know your enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”. Sadly, it seems that Pakistan is erring in assessing the collective capabilities of the TTP, supported by the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

A common factor was the existence of a combination of extremely resilient militant groups resisting both superpowers. This combination consisted of three categories of militants: local Afghan militants resisting foreign invaders; Pakistani militants crossing over to help their Afghan brethren; and thousands of mujahideen from various countries, particularly in the Middle East, participating in the Afghan jihad. With some variations in their composition, role and external supporters, they fought together against the US and USSR for 30 years, forcing them to withdraw. Alarmingly, after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, this Afghanistan-based lethal troika now targets Pakistan. The situation necessitates a fundamental shift in the terrorist threat assessment in Pakistan — from focusing exclusively on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan to broadening the threat calculus to the troika of the TTP, Afghan Taliban, and Al Qaeda. Concerning the nexus between the Taliban and TTP, the latest UN report on Afghanistan states that the Afghan government was supplying weapons, training facilities and regular financial packages to the TTP. Al Qaeda’s primary goal, after lying low in the region for many years, is to revive itself without annoying its Afghan hosts or attracting the West’s adverse attention. In view of this, it seems to have opted to carry out its activities in Pakistan through the TTP, while staying below the international radar. The importance Al Qaeda gives to the TTP is evident in that it selected 15 of its commanders to assist the group conduct terrorist attacks in Pakistan. It also supplied armed fighters to the TTP in its attack in Chitral in September 2023, which killed four security officials. Al Qaeda’s camp in Kunar, headed by Hakim ul Masri, is responsible for training suicide bombers for the TTP. The TTP, which has been the most lethal terrorist group in Pakistan over the last three years, is on the same page with the Taliban and Al Qaeda not only because of an ideological affinity and a shared history of fighting foreign invaders in Afghanistan, but also due to similar goals of Sharia enforcement in Pakistan. The TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. There were reports of the TTP helping the other two members of the troika by killing Taliban members defecting to the rival Islamic State-Khorasan Province in Afghanistan. The basic point is that while the troika is united on targeting Pakistan, the members play different roles. The Taliban are likely to help TTP discreetly in Afghanistan by providing sanctuary, with Al Qaeda supporting both openly in Afghanistan through mentoring and in Pakistan through its sympathisers. With its edge, the TTP is likely to carry out ground attacks in Pakistan and lead a campaign to build up its narrative of violent extremism. As far as the strategy and tactics to be adopted by the troika go, the TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. In a recent interview to Khorasan Diary, TTP ameer Noor Wali Mehsud stated, “our jihad in Pakistan … has entered a decisive phase”. He went on to say ominously: “Pakistani security agencies have unjustly occupied our homeland” and “our goal is to liberate our homeland and implement the divine law”. In a nutshell, the TTP seems to be falling back on the two-point narrative of resistance in Afghanistan, ie, ‘liberation of homeland’ and ‘enforcement of divine laws’. This brings us to the likely impact of the troika on the terrorist threat landscape in Pakistan. Since 2021, the number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan has been consistently increasing every year. This is likely to continue in 2024, with three possible changes. One, the number of Afghan nationals taking part in terrorist attacks in Pakistan may increase — we recall here the suicide bombing against military personnel in 2023 in Bannu by Afghans. Two, given its penchant for high-profile attacks, Al Qaeda may train the TTP to carry out such attacks. Three, given that the top Al Qaeda and Taliban instructors will train TTP members, the quality and sophistication of the attacks in 2024 are likely to be enhanced. Another area likely to be impacted by the troika is infiltration. Earlier, in the 1990s, Al Qaeda infiltrated educational institutions such as Karachi and Punjab universities to recruit educated youth. These recruitment cells in universities may be reactivated. Also, to stay abreast of latest government planning in counterterrorism, the TTP, like the Taliban did in Afghanistan, may attempt to infiltrate government departments, including intel agencies. The third and most important dimension of infiltration is that of the military, which was carried out by Al Qaeda in Pakistan in the late 1990s. It may be pertinent to mention that the last attempted terrorist attack by Al Qaeda was in 2014 in Karachi, when a group of naval officers tried to hijack a navy frigate and crash into a US ship in the open seas. Al Qaeda worked somewhat openly in Pakistan from the 1980s to 2001, and built up an elaborate network of civilian volunteers in many cities of Pakistan, who assisted in collecting funds, recruiting volunteers, and providing hideouts for the group. These sleeper cells might again be contacted by it and reactivated. Similarly, there were some Pakistani militant organisations of the 1980s, like the Harkatul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, etc, sympathetic to Al Qaeda and lying low these days. Al Qaeda may re-establish contact with them and get their support for the TTP. Finally, both the Taliban and Al Qaeda are known for their high-quality propaganda campaign. The TTP media wing lacks that finesse. In the light of guidance from the Taliban and Al Qaeda, we are likely to witness a significant improvement in the quality of propaganda.

Exports to the European Union states have begun to dip in the current fiscal year despite a GSP+ status that allows most Pakistani goods a duty-free entrance into European markets. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan, to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on exports to Europe. In absolute terms, Pakistan’s exports to the EU dipped to $6.105bn in 9MFY24 from $6.27bn in the corresponding months of last year. According to figures compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, the decline was mainly due to reduced demand for Pakistani goods in western, southern, and northern Europe. In FY23, exports to the EU dropped 4.41pc to $8.188bn from $8.566bn in the preceding fiscal year. Western Europe, which includes countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Belgium, accounts for the largest portion of Pakistan’s exports to the EU. However, exports to this region have significantly decreased by 12pc. The export value stood at $2.947bn in the first nine months of FY24, down from $3.353bn during the same period last year. While exports to western, southern, and northern Europe have declined, there is a silver lining in the form of an uptick in exports to Eastern Europe. The exports saw an increase of 8.38pc to $466.19m in 9MFY24, up from $430.14m in the corresponding months last year. Exports to southern Europe declined 1.24pc to $2.216bn in 9MFY24 from $2.244bn in the corresponding period last year. In this region, exports to Spain grew 3.73pc to $1.084 in 9MFY24 from $1.045bn last year. Exports to Italy declined 3.22pc to $825.44m in 9MFY24, compared to $852.93 m in the same period last year. However, exports to northern Europe witnessed a 2.31pc dip. The export value to this region stood at $475.92m, down from $487.19m in the corresponding period last year. Before Brexit, Pakistan’s major export destination was the United Kingdom. In the post-Brexit period, Pakistan’s exports to the UK slightly went up to $1.529bn in 9MFY24 from $1.494bn over the corresponding period of last year, indicating an increase of 2.34pc. In FY23, Pakistan’s exports dipped by 10.63pc to $1.966bn to the UK from $2.20bn in the same period of the preceding year. The British government, however, has assured Islamabad that there will be no change in the post-Brexit scenario, as evident from Pakistan’s inclusion in its preferential market access scheme.

The prominent and influential Gulf state is one of few Arab states with official diplomatic ties to Israel, which it has maintained through Israel’s more than six-month war in Gaza, although relations appear to have become frayed. Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan rebuked Netanyahu in an early morning post on X, saying Abu Dhabi denounced the Israeli leader’s comments. “The UAE stresses that the Israeli prime minister does not have any legal capacity to take this step, and the UAE refuses to be drawn into any plan aimed at providing cover for the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip,” he said in an Arabic post. Sheikh Abdullah said the UAE would be prepared to support a Pale\xadstinian government that met the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people, which he said included independence. In an interview, Netanyahu said the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other countries could possibly assist a civilian government with Gazans in the enclave after the war. Sources said that Abu Dhabi’s relationship with Netanyahu has fractured over the military campaign, with Emirati officials now rarely speaking with him.

In a recent interview to SAMAA TV, he emphasised the urgent need for men to take the lead in condemning and criminalising harassment in all its forms. He also took pride in belonging to a family that boasts accomplished women. “I’m very proud of them and grateful. It’s a fact that when women in your family are independent and powerful, they can support you and become your strength. But it is unfortunate that even today, women have to face harassment in all professional fields, whether it’s the corporate [world] or the showbiz.” The Pyarey Afzal and Alif actor added that the onus of fostering a safe and supportive environment for women lies on men because they’re the ones to blame for perpetuating a culture of silence and complicity. Calling for greater solidarity from men and emphasising the importance of creating inclusive environments where women can thrive professionally, Abbasi said, “We [men] should play a leading role in this situation. “We have to make sure that wherever we see harassment, we don’t accept it. We demonise it. We don’t encourage or normalise it. Because unfortunately, we, men, have normalised and celebrated such behaviour. We didn’t scrutinise it the way it should have been scrutinised. So we need to call out and criminalise such behaviour in our circles,” he added. Abbasi commended women who have spoken up against harassment and encouraged dialogue around the issue. “It gives me great optimism that in today’s day and age, women are very forthcoming and are calling out harassment, whether it’s online or at the workplace. The times when women would face harassment and stay mum about it are thankfully behind us.” The Legend of Maula Jatt star emphasised the need to encourage such behaviour among women. “The culture of speaking up also needs to be encouraged. Women should be able to make noise wherever they are if ever they face harassment of any kind. Without any fear or hesitation, women should be encouraged to raise hell. We need to eradicate the element of fear and shame among women.” By speaking out against harassment, Abbasi sends a powerful message to men everywhere — it is incumbent upon us to stand up, speak out, and actively work towards creating a world where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.

But for Hindu supremacy to be fully realised, which is the stated aim of Hindu nationalists, they will have to expunge India of any Muslim influence, of which there is much, historically. When Indians cast their vote in the coming weeks, they would do well to be aware of the weight of their electoral choices. And the international community would do well not to drop the ball on India. In a recent article, political scientists, Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs asked the rhetorical question: “Is India under Narendra Modi … beginning to resemble the American South under Jim Crow?” referring to state and local laws introduced in the southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th century that enforced racial segregation. They explain that Jim Crow laws were aimed at blunting the Reconstruction Amendments that abolished slavery and gave equal rights to Blacks. They were designed to make Blacks second-class citizens. Similarly, in India, Hindu nationalists seek to diminish the constitutionally guaranteed equal citizenship of Muslims and turn them into marginalised, less than fully equal citizens. Jim Crow laws lasted for almost a century, ending only in the 1960s. Varshney and Staggs claim that since Hindu nationalism is in its early phase, it could still be forestalled before it is institutionalised via political and legislative processes. They suggest that the ongoing national elections present an opportunity for Indians to do that. However, the comparison between Jim Crow and Hindu nationalism diverges in their ultimate objectives. While Jim Crow merely targeted the equal citizenship of Blacks, Hindu nationalism has a more totalitarian goal. To fully grasp the end-goals of Hindu nationalism or Hindutva, it is necessary to read its foundational texts. There are none more seminal than We or Our Nationhood Defined (1939) by Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, who led the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) from 1940 to 1973. The RSS is considered the heart and soul of the vast network of Hindu nationalist organisations, of which the BJP is the political wing. Narendra Modi, a life-time member and former official of the RSS, credited it for grooming him to political leadership. In his text, Golwalkar writes of his wariness of “hostile elements” within the country that “act as menace to national security”, singling out Muslims as the number one threat, followed by Christians. His solution to “the danger of a cancer developing into its body politic” was offering the “foreign element” two options: “either to merge themselves in the national race and adopt its culture or to live at its mercy so long as the national race may allow it to do so, and to quit the country at the sweet will of the national race”. MS Golwalkar. Credit: Golwalkarguruji.org — image via Scroll.in Another of the movement’s foundational texts is Essentials of Hindutva (1923) by Vinayak Damodar Savakar, who is considered by many to be the foremost Hindutva thinker. In Essentials, he provided Hindu nationalism with an ideology, which in a nutshell claims that India was special, as it offered something nobody else could — Hindu thought. This unique Hindu supremacy, Savarkar believed, was under threat because of the presence of non-Hindus. He called on Hindus, fragmented as they were, to unite and reclaim their supremacy. Violence against Muslims, Savarkar said, was the means to achieve that goal. Golwalkar drew on Savarkar’s thoughts. He also admired the race theories of fascist Germany and Italy and recommended that Hindustan, the land of Hindus, should profit from their lessons. In We or Our Nationhood Defined, he wrote: “To keep up the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of its semitic races — the Jews. Race pride at its highest has been manifested here.” Golwalkar saw the world in apocalyptic terms. His objective was clear: “To rule over the world was the heavenly task ordained to Hindu race.” He called upon Hindus to “rally to the Hindu standard, the bhagwa dhwaj [and] set our teeth in grim determination to wipe out the opposing forces”. Some Hindutva leaders today have explicitly articulated this vision. For instance, in March 2020, a Hindu priest named Yati Narsinghanand, who is the president of Akhil Bharatiya Sant Parishad (All India Priests Council) and someone close to the BJP, was reported to have told his followers, “Humanity can only be saved if Islam is finished off. Hindus: Read the Gita along with Mahabharat, and learn how to die fighting.” This call was made around the time BJP leader Kapil Mishra was leading processions in Delhi calling for violence against the mainly Muslim participants in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, chanting the mantra: “Desh ke ghaddaron ko, goli maro saalon ko [Shoot the traitors of the country].” In 2023, another BJP leader, an MLA from Telangana, T Raja Singh, at a rally in Mumbai, urged his audience to take to arms. “I would like to request all my Hindu brothers that the coming time is the time of struggle, it is the time of war,” he said. “Every Hindu is obliged to unite. Hindu should not become one who rings temple bells, but rather he should become a Hindu who kills landyas”, a derogatory reference to Muslims. At a public meeting of Hindu priests in December 2021, in the holy town of Haridwar, a star speaker, Annapurna Maa, the general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, was heard exhorting her audience:  “If you want to eliminate their population, then be ready to kill them and be ready to go to jail. If only a 100 of us become soldiers and each of us kills 20 lakhs of them, we will be victorious…” Modi is circumspect in his speeches now, but was not always so. As chief minister of Gujarat, soon after the pogrom there in 2002 during his term that left at least 2,000 dead, mostly Muslim, he was often reported in his public speeches to evoke visions of a religious struggle of good over evil. “This is the holy place of shakti [godly power], the power for extermination of asuras [demons],” he said in one speech. “We have resolved to destroy and stamp out all forces of evil…” Beyond the goal of cleansing the Hindu land of the “cancer” to save the nation, there is another equally compelling reason for the Hindutva project to be more than just about marginalising Muslims. That has to do with the fact that India today is, in the words of historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot, “an intricate montage assembled from assorted material”, of which the Islamic is a critical element. The desire on the part of Hindutva leaders to fully realise Hindu supremacy will also require extirpating Muslim life and Muslim imprint from today’s India. Historians view the era between 1200 AD and 1750 AD (Medieval India in history textbooks) as the foundation for the highly diverse human landscape of modern South Asia, with its pluralistic culture that draws on both Indic and Islamic traditions. In their magisterial work, India Before Europe (2006), Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot show how the Central Asian ethnic heritage, Persian cultural orientation and Islamic religious affiliation of North India’s ruling elite class in the period after 1200 AD led to the dissemination of many innovative elements through the subcontinent. While acknowledging that the encounter between Indic and Islamic peoples and cultures led to short-term conflicts, Asher and Talbot note the vast degree to which cultural practices inspired by Perso-Islamic traditions became integral to the subcontinent as a whole in the long run. South Asia’s art and architecture, its political rituals, its administrative and military technologies and even its popular religions were deeply inflected by the new forms. This composite culture, the authors note, forms the basis of India that exists today, in its foods, dressing and music, languages that people speak, the built architecture, and its popular religions, among others. The ruins of the Krishna temple in Hampi, Karnataka, in 1868. Credit: Lyon, Edmund David (1825-1891)., Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons — taken from Scroll.in In the south of the peninsula, the ‘Hindu’ Vijaynagara empire (1350-1550) drew significantly from Islamicate influence in military technology, secular architecture, courtly dress, as well as local languages. The successor ‘Muslim’ sultanates of the Bahmani state in the Deccan too, followed in this tradition, most importantly in their patronage to local languages, so much so that Golconda rulers, around today’s Hyderabad, occupied an important place in the historical memory of Telengana language — with one of the sultans, Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah (1550-1580) often called Ibharama Chakravati by Telgu poets. Bijapur’s Ibrahim Adil Shah II (1580-1627), called Jagat Guru, authored a collection of songs in dakani, Kitab-e-Nauras (book of nine rasas), that opens with an invocation to Saraswati, Hindu goddess of learning, followed by praise of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and then the Chisti saint Gisu Daraz. These were no exceptions. In Bengal, the Hussain Shahi (1493-1538) rulers adopted local customs, such as purification by the water of Ganga at coronation ceremonies, and the Sufi poet, Saiyid Sultan (d 1648) published a genealogy of prophets of Islam, called Nabi Vamsha that included the Hindu god, Krishna. In Gujarat, amid the flourishing literary tradition that the Ahmad Shah rulers patronised was the Sanskrit work Raja-Vinoda (pleasure of the kings), written in honour of the ruler, Mahmud Begada (1460s), presenting the sultan as an ideal Indic king, whose court was graced by the presence of the Hindu deity Saraswati, the goddess of learning. In Malwa, in central India, capital Mandu had fine libraries that included among their collection the track Nimat-nama (c. 1500), an illustrated recipe book for making dishes suitable for all seasons, including vegetarian as well as meat-based, with illustrations drawing on both Persian and Indic tradition, including the Bhagwata Purana. However, it was the Mughals, especially Akbar (1556-1605), who helped create a state that was more Indian in character. The aesthetic that developed under Akbar’s guidance was composed of a fusion of Timurid and Indic models, and which went on to set a standard for subsequent Mughal arts and culture, including food, architecture and courtly dress and culture, Asher and Talbot argue. Besides, in the realm of built architecture, of which there is ample evidence, literary production was an important site of Indic and Islamic collaboration. Examples are the translation of Ramayana and Mahabharata in Persian (Razm-nama) and Abul Fazl’s including in his Ain-i-Akbari, extensive sections on “the learning of India” — including philosophical schools, music, life cycle rituals, and modes of image worship. The scale of the borrowing led Audrey Truschke, a prominent historian of Sanskrit at the Mughal court, to conclude that these were efforts on the part of Abul Fazl to convince Akbar’s supporters of the virtues of infusing Sanskrit knowledge into Indo-Persian thought. The tendencies towards synthesis had significant consequences. Man Singh, the highest ranking noble in Akbar’s court, only after his sons, built temples throughout the domain, including the Govinda Deva temples in Vrindavan, the largest in North India, in a recognisably Mughal style, and helped to spread Akbar’s belief in multiculturalism, just as Abdul Rahim Khaan-e-Khanan did by commissioning an illustrated Ramayana. Among the most consequential contributions of the Mughal court to Indian letters, Allison Busch shows, was its engagement with Brajbhasha. A local (Hindavi) dialect of the region around Agra and Delhi, Mughal heartlands, Brajbhasha had existed until then, mostly as bhakti devotional poetry. Under Mughal patronage, it developed a sophisticated courtly style, inspired by Sanskrit poetics, and became the principal poetic language of north India. In creating the outcome, that could be described as classical Hindi, were Akbar’s nobles composing works in the language, including Todar Mal, Birbal and the Rajput nobles, as also Faizi and Abdul Rahim Khana Khanan — showing how courtly literature in Brajbhasha was nurtured within the multicultural context of elite Mughal society. There were other enduring contributions too, of this age and milieu, outside the courtly realm. A major influence in the early part of this period was Sufis, and their dispersal, throughout much of the subcontinent. By the 14th century, the practice of Sama, devotional musical congregations, and Urs, annual pilgrimage to the shrines of Sufi saints, had become established Sufi traditions. Sufi shrines drew both Muslims and Hindus, and were themselves influenced by local traditions, including the Shattari Sufis of Bengal drawing on Nath yogis, and Rishi Sufis of Kashmir who led celibate lives and practised vegetarianism. Sufism also contributed to reform in Hindu tradition, starting in the 14th century with the rise of sants, who like Sufis, were mystics, believed in a formless God, and extolled devotion to God as a primary religious practice. Kabir, the most influential, attacked rituals and customs of traditional religions, and excoriated the caste system. Guru Nanak (born in 1469), the founder of the Sikh tradition, also came from the same context. Notably, Sufism also influenced Hindu bhakti tradition, as the historian of Indian religion John S Hawley points out. This is evident in the commonalities that the latter began to show in its focus on love for God, as did Sufis, the use of poetry and music in worship, and an ethics of compassion for others. Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas (1575), crafted in about the same age and the middle Gangetic Awadhi milieu of Sufi poets, Malik Mohammad Jayasi (Padmavat, 1540) and Mir Siyyid Manjhan (Madhumalati, 1545), exemplified this shift. Ram, an incarnation of Vishnu, became the preeminent object of devotion, in place of Siva. It is these constructions of a cosmopolitan Indian paradigm, resulting in innovations that spoke to both traditions that Hindu nationalists must disentangle and destroy to be able to achieve their vision of a Hindu supremacist India. This will undoubtedly leave much violence in its trail. These historical accounts of co-living and co-production contradict Hindutva claims that have much purchase today, in popular as well as scholarly circles about the thousand years of conflict between Muslim “outsiders” and “local” Hindus; of forced conversions and the wanton destruction of temples. Hindu nationalists have developed a wide repertoire of suffering and victimhood of Hindus at the hands of Muslims. Evidence to support their thesis is slim. Richard Eaton, one of the foremost historians of medieval India, shows how the claim that Islam spread in South Asia by the sword is incongruent with the geography of Muslim conversions in South Asia. There is an inverse relationship between the degree of Muslim political penetration and the degree of conversion to Islam, he notes. Most conversions happened in the north west and north east — Punjab and Bengal, farthest away from centres of Muslim power. As to temple destruction, Eaton found, over a span of more than five centuries from 1192 to 1729, there were “some 80 instances of temple desecration”, well short of the 60,000 claimed by Hindu nationalists. Typically, the desecrated temples would have been associated with the authority of an enemy kingdom. The instances of desecrations followed a long-established pattern in India, of temples having been natural sites for the contestation of kingly authority, well before the coming of Muslim Turks, including their destruction. Among the most recent examples was the destruction in the 10th c of the Pratihara temple of Kalapriya near Jamuna, by the Rashtrakuta king Indra III. But as the Bosnian historian, Edin Hajdarpasic, shows from his study of Balkan nationalism in the 19th century, enthusiastic depictions of suffering convey the essence of a political threat more vividly than simple facts or documentary narratives — a phenomenon he calls “authentic fantasy”. Hindu nationalists, themselves inspired by European nationalist movements at the turn of the 19th century, relied much on the construction of suffering and victimhood of Hindus, however divorced from facts. Decolonial historiography shows how they drew on the Orientalist bias of British colonial historians, who saw the period of the previous 600 years, as a history of Muslim arrival and their dominance over Hindus, marked by Muslim fanaticism, and temple destruction, forced conversion, and Hindu oppression. In contrast to the dark Muslim medieval age, colonial historians like James Mill posited the ancient Hindu age as golden, and modern British, as liberal. Hindu nationalists in power today are seeking to inflict retribution for their perceived sufferings by rewriting history. In some cases, this has taken physical forms — such as in the destruction in 1992 of the 15th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, a criminal act that was legitimised by the Supreme Court of India in 2019. Claims for several other historical mosques to be converted into temples have been set in motions across the country. Elsewhere, place names have been changed to erase any hint of their Muslim heritage. Allahabad is now Prayagraj, Mughalsarai station is Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction, Aurangabad is Sambhajinagar and Gulbarga is Kalaburagi. Not satisfied with occasional erasures, the BJP government has thought fit to change high school history and politics textbooks by significantly altering and in some cases, fully scrapping the sections on Mughal history. Credit: Yasminsheikh, CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons — taken from Scroll.in The act of political forgetting targets minorities to deprive them of history, of the right to narrate, of the capacity for recognition. History tells us it is also a precursor to violence. As eminent historians Aditya and Mridula Mukherjee noted recently, “…genocide of a community is often preceded by the community being demonised, their names changed, their history being erased”, claiming “these processes have begun in India and open calls for genocide of Muslims are being given in various parts of the country with amazing impunity”. More than Jim Crow South, the history of the Balkans in the late 19th century and post-Yugoslavia 20th century provides a better guide to understanding the future of minorities in India today. Hajdarpasic’s account of Balkan history alerts us to the real consequences of the claims of victimhood. Nationalists there used stories of suffering not only to inspire collective sacrifice but also to encourage mass violence against entire communities perceived as threats. He demonstrates how certain stories of victimisation in the region long outlived their original inspirations. Decades after overthrowing Turkish rule, Serbian nationalists could revive narratives about Turk-like enemies even in the late 20th century with catastrophic consequences. Tanika Sarkar, eminent historian of modern India, demonstrates similar impulse in early modern Hindu nationalist thought. Emblematic of this repertoire was Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s 1818 novel, Anandmath, whose main character, the Hindu sanyasi (ascetic) rebel, Satyanand, is engaged in a messianic battle “for exterminate(ing) all Muslims on this land, as they are enemies of God”, a recompense for “inflicting misfortune on Hindus”. The novel is set in the context of the 1770 famines in Bengal, as the East India Company was inserting itself at the expense of the Nawabs of Bengal, and that resulted in a third of the population starving to death, both Hindus and Muslims. Historians inform Muslim fakirs (ascetics) rose up, along with sanyasis, against the depredations. Sarkar calls for Anandmath, “the first explicit message in our literary history for ethnic cleansing”, one foretelling Hindu nationalist thoughts to emerge later in 20th century. Its protagonists deemed “elimination of Muslim rule and Muslim presence from the land” an act of worship of Bharat Maata (motherland), a deity that first emerged in the novel. In 1920, Savarkar and Golwalkar adopted Vande Mataram — hymn to Bharat Maata, contained in Anandmath — as  aHindu nationalist anthem. Vande Mataram was also the rallying cry of Hindu communalists in anti-Muslim violence to follow during Partition. Vande Mataram continues to inspire Hindu nationalist thoughts and action to this day. So when the terror-accused BJP MP Pragya Thakur recently instructed her audience to “keep your weapons sharpened”, to “in this world created by god … finish all oppressors, wrong-doers, sinners…”, she was deploying Anandmath’s template of the holy war — calling for violence against the entire Muslim population. It is in such violent contestations borne out of ‘authentic fantasies’ of past sufferings that Hindu nationalists of today — following that of Savarkar and other Hindutva ideologues — seek to create Hindu supremacy, by waging permanent war against India’s 200 or so million Muslims and other ‘foreign elements’. Already, United Nations experts are alerting us to the fact that “India risks becoming one of the world’s main generators of instability, atrocities and violence, because of the massive scale and gravity of the violations and abuses targeting mainly religious and other minorities, such as Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and others.” Mass atrocity experts are warning:  “If nothing is done to address these risks, India may continue to experience a rise in the number of violent (and fatal) attacks against religious minorities, an escalation in the scale of the violence, and an increased level of state involvement in atrocities.” The burden on Indian voters to use the ballot to forestall the institutionalisation of Hindu nationalism, before it reaches a point of no return, is therefore, even heavier.

Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'FIFA’S FOUL ON PAKISTAN FOOTBALL - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'Apathy, manipulation and intrigue seem to define Pakistan football. While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders. But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well. FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone — including over interference in the PFF elections. Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a “Normalisation Committee” (NC) in 2019. It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board. But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way. One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it — Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik — is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket’s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport. This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF — even after his departure following elections for a new governing body — and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains. Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport. But is a franchise system like cricket’s PSL the best way forward? And why is an interim football administration pushing for it? FAR FROM NORMALISED On a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi’s north. There was an extravagant ceremony before the match, with fireworks aplenty.\xa0\xa0It was the opening match of the Ramazan Gold Cup. Sights like these have become few and far between in Pakistan football and the PFF had nothing to do with it. This tournament had been organised privately, with domestic football activity having become non-existent in the country. The Pakistan Premier Football League (PPFL), the country’s top-tier competition, hasn’t been held by the PFF since 2018. It’s something that has irked Pakistan’s history-making head coach Stephen Constantine. Constantine — who has been demanding that the league be restarted — wasn’t in attendance at the Naya Nazimabad Football Stadium, however. The 61-year-old Englishman was in Lahore, overseeing the national team’s preparations for its upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan. A day earlier in Lahore, Constantine was visibly irate during an interaction with reporters. Peppered with questions regarding Pakistan’s chances against Jordan — who had recently ended as runners-up in the Asian Cup — the English coach was blunt and unforgiving. Time and again, Constantine has reiterated that it is fundamentally important that Pakistan revives its league structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition. Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp. He was merely repeating himself six months on. He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year. For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league. “I just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,” he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny — disputed at several levels — carried out by the stopgap NC. “You don’t need every district to be part of the league. We had a Challenge Cup with 32 teams. Just take 16 teams from it and start the bloody league.” What Constantine doesn’t know is that the PFF’s internal problems aren’t the only impediment to the revival and resumption of the domestic league. More than a year before his appointment as the chairman of the FIFA appointed ‘Normalisation Committee’ in December 2021, Haroon Malik visited the FIFA headquarters in Zurich for a ‘secret meeting’ that would determine the future trajectory of Pakistan football. GAMING THE SYSTEM To be fair, Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 — which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA — to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all. This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country’s and clubs’ abysmal performance in international competitions. The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC. One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee’s association, remains disputed. In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote — against the PFF Constitution — in the ongoing district elections. These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF’s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections. A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community. There’s a method to the madness, however. Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations. Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo). The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president. Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women’s national championship. With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate’s favour. With clubs — that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 — set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs. The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency. In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time. Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year. To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA’s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik’s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021. In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football. Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out\nof the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. Pakistan head coach Stephen Constantine with his players during a training session at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium in Islamabad in November 2023: the Englishman has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the lack of regular domestic football in the country | White Star THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF PAKISTAN FOOTBALL On a cold December afternoon in 2019, Haroon Malik posed for a picture outside the FIFA headquarters in Zurich. “Discussing Pakistan football! Invigorating meetings, exciting times!” he captioned the picture on X, then known as Twitter. The discussions that took place in the Swiss city on that day would shape the future of Pakistan football. Plans for it had been set in motion months before. In August 2019, a month before FIFA first announced the NC for the PFF, global professional services firm KPMG had begun reaching out to people with knowledge of Pakistan football. During its initial correspondence, the KPMG Football Benchmark department said that it had started “an exciting project on football in Pakistan for a prominent client.” When discussions began, it emerged that it wanted to discuss the holding of a franchise league in Pakistan. Around that same time, a Facebook page was launched by the name of Football Club Pakistan (FCPK). Those working for the page aimed at providing football updates and were employed by media communications company Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan — the Pakistan branch of Starcom, which is headquartered in Chicago and which, in turn, is a subsidiary of global marketing and communication giants Publicis Groupe. FCPK was Malik’s first foray into Pakistan football. Some 15 months after FCPK was launched, the Canadian-Pakistani tech entrepreneur was named the chairman of the PFF Normalisation Committee, following the resignation of his predecessor Humza Khan. But it is what Malik was doing in those intervening months that made his appointment one that raises issues of conflict of interest. A FOOTBALLING CHESSBOARD Back in 2019, leading the discussions on that “exciting project on football in Pakistan” was KPMG’s former sports advisory manager, Yacine Sosse Alaoui. Alaoui has since left KPMG, joining FIFA as its business intelligence manager in September 2020. But a little over six months earlier, in February 2020, Alaoui and Andrea Sartori, the head of KPMG Football Benchmark, had accompanied Malik for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, where they met with officials from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) about what Malik called “discussing opportunities and ideas for Pakistan football.” Malik had not been named as head of the NC at that time. “Haroon Malik came to the AFC in 2020 with people from KPMG,” a source in Asian football’s governing body told Eos. “Discussions with the marketing department centred on\xa0a\xa0competition.” When\xa0the AFC was asked about that visit, a spokesperson of Asia’s football governing body termed it “a courtesy visit.” In fact, it was the December 2019 meeting in Zurich that had reportedly set up discussions with the AFC. The FIFA headquarters is a seven-storey building: two floors above ground and five underground. It was a closed-doors secret meeting on one of those levels that would script the future of Pakistan football. In alleged attendance alongside Sartori, Alaoui and Malik were Mario Gallavotti, the Italian lawyer who heads FIFA’s independent committees; Romy Gai, the chairman of London-based sports industry operators AWE International Group; and Pakistani advertising mogul Raihan Merchant. The proposal was laid out for holding a franchise league in Pakistan with Gallavotti and Gai — who would in 2022 become FIFA’s chief business officer — on board. Their interests remain unknown, but the talk in FIFA at that time was “that something big was going to happen in Pakistan football.” Sartori, Gai and Gallavotti are all Italian. When FIFA was approached for comment in 2022 regarding that meeting, its spokesperson gave a stern reply: “Please be informed that there are no updates regarding the matter you’ve mentioned.” The world football body did not comment on whether Gallavotti and Gai were part of that meeting, although they did not deny it either. Meanwhile Merchant, when contacted by Eos, denied his presence at the meeting. A source close to the discussion, however, says otherwise: “They [Gallavotti and Gai] were really pushing for the league to happen,” the source told\xa0Eos. “The purpose of the meeting seemed to push for its endorsement.” It was clear that Malik and his associates didn’t want to come out as rebels.\xa0They wanted to hold the league with the PFF’s blessings, as part of the domestic calendar, but also as sole holders of all rights for the event. Football was going to be the third sports discipline Z2C Limited — the holding company for ventures owned by Merchant, which also has Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan, now Brainchild Communications — was going to organise a league for. Malik has been an executive director at Z2C since January 2019 — a position he still holds. Merchant and Malik also are alumni of the same university. Malik’s FCPK would become the ideal social media tool to propagate the league. Meanwhile, Z2C also had BSports — a sports app that combined social and data feeds with a livestream of sports events. It also had digital rights for the Pakistan Super League. The question being raised is whether Malik’s interest is in putting the affairs of the PFF in order as head of the NC or to push forward the franchise league he is invested in. Haroon Malik’s Instagram post showing him at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on December 5, 2019, more than a year before his appointment by FIFA as the NC chairman | Instagram/roon.toon FIFA’S ROLE While giving another nine-month extension to Haroon Malik and his team till March 2024 — originally the NC had been appointed in September 2019 till June 2020, while Haroon was appointed the NC chairman in January 2021, for a nine-month period — FIFA\xa0had\xa0warned of possible sanctions being imposed if PFF elections weren’t held by then. But despite little headway being made and multiple deadlines being missed, FIFA has once again extended its mandate till December 2024. “Of course, it’s those links high up in FIFA,” one source close to the matter tells\xa0Eos. “With Haroon there, the franchise league plan stays alive.” In the meantime, most former Starcom employees are now working for the PFF, a simple LinkedIn search will show. Hasnain Haider, PFF’s head of digital media, was a project manager at Starcom. PFF’s football performance analyst, Irtaza Hussain, was community manager for FCPK at Starcom. PFF’s current creative manager, Haider Ali, was formerly at Z2C. While the NC has been unable to pay dues to players of the national teams because of an audit objection raised by FIFA, the employees continue to get paid by funds coming in from the global football body. “The PFF is effectively being run by Starcom,” a source in the NC tells\xa0Eos. “The groundwork is being laid for the franchise league they want to hold.” Malik, though, hasn’t been the only one looking to organise a football league in Pakistan. UK-based TouchSky Group, Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa football official Shahid Shinwari have all publicly stated their intentions of doing so as well. TouchSky, later rebranded as Global Soccer Ventures and now repackaged as Pakistan Football League, is set to unveil its franchise league next month. It has set a date of November 1 to hold its franchise league which, contrary to the brochures it has been sending out, does not have the endorsement of the English Premier League\xa0or\xa0its\xa0clubs. But with the PFF having the final say over any league, Haroon’s position as the NC chief, which will see him hold elections for a new executive committee of the country’s football governing body, means there is a conflict of interest, even if he says that FIFA doesn’t think there is any. “Anyone associated with football, anywhere in the world, would have some stake in the game,” Haroon told\xa0Eos\xa0in April 2021. “It is normal, and natural. You cannot have someone who knows nothing about football, nothing about the market that they are operating in, and be responsible for football. Employers determine if conflict of interests are potentially troublesome. FIFA determined that my commercial interests have no conflict with this role [as NC chief]. If FIFA is okay, then that is the final word.” In fact, FIFA did not specifically comment on Haroon’s commercial interests having a conflict with his role, but its spokesperson said that “in\xa0line with standard procedures, all members of the Normalisation Committee were subject to stringent eligibility checks.” The spokesperson did not disclose whether FIFA had knowledge of Haroon’s elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: “FIFA has no further comment at this stage.” TAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSL In 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL. Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league. But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later. Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines. With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren’t the only ones. For some time, Badar “Bobby” Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C’s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021. “They just can’t get it together,” he said. Badar has been involved in almost every sport — from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships. “Working on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],” he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL. Puyol’s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan. Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky — who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event — had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League. The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan. TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon’s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed. ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES? Haroon Malik’s and Z2C’s plans had already taken off the ground by then. Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed. And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik’s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared — thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s key advisers. But Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league — only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months. Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports. “Looking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,” Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL. “A hybrid model transitioning into promotion/relegation makes sense to me. [America’s] Major League Soccer, [Japan’s] J-League is a good conversation starter.” Malik expanded on this: “So many possibilities. Bottom line — either one is good for the players! Get them playing! Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast. Not insurmountable!” When asked why a traditional league model — which would see the country’s football club culture thrive — might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, “We are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere.” However, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies. Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football. Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions. The Major League Soccer (MLS) — a franchise league system — has achieved huge popularity in the United States. The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year. In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country’s national league. Its current season, which began in September, will culminate\xa0in\xa0May. Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their\xa0programmes. This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides. With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC’s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions. Malik, however, believes that wouldn’t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him. “Setting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,” he said during that exchange. “Once that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place.” Malik’s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast. But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration. When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate. The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process. Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik’s control of the election process and the federation. TIME TO TURN A CORNER Such control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik’s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition. If a candidate they’re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped. It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C. “Gallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA’s inner circle, closest to Infantino,” one source in the global football body tells\xa0Eos. “If they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later.” FIFA’s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence. The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC’s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history. But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country’s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable. Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country. When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan — Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC — for the event. A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan’s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand. The NC later stated that the clubs weren’t interested in participating at the SAFF event. It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations. Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one. As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA’s inner circle.

Copyright © 2024 NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Packaging film sector on the rise - Business - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'The processed food sector in Pakistan is witnessing a significant growth in demand, spurring investment in both the food processing and packaging material industries. National Foods has invested Rs7 billion to establish its largest state-of-the-art production plant in Faisalabad, and International Packaging Films, a subsidiary of International Packaging Films Ltd (IPAK), has enhanced its flexible packaging film production capacity in Lahore, bringing its total investment in its three manufacturing facilities to Rs13.5bn. Moreover, both companies plan to vigorously explore export markets for their products. “We plan to export $15-20 million worth of flexible packaging films this year, which is roughly 20 per cent of our total production capacity of 152,000 tonnes,” IPAK CEO Naveed Godil says. Food packaging is an important growth driver, enabling consumers to look for different options and compare the value offerings before making a purchase. “Packaging also helps enhance the portability of products, preserves taste, and increases shelf life,” he notes, adding that his company holds a 38pc flexible film packaging market share in the country. ‘The total local market size is Rs80-100bn, and we expect an annual growth of 7-8pc in flexible packaging films by food companies in the country’ Pakistan’s demand for flexible packaging films is approximately 200,000 tonnes against a total production capacity of 300,000 tonnes, leaving a surplus of 100,000 tonnes for export. The company’s revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 41pc in the last three years. The rapid growth in its revenues, fueled by enhanced production capacity, has encouraged the company to conduct book building on May 8-9 for its Initial Public Offering (IPO) through the sale of 70.1m shares, representing 10pc of its post-IPO capital, in a new stock issuance. A quarter of the shares being offered on the market will be sold to retail investors. The IPO — the 14th in the last five years — will help it raise Rs1.47bn at a floor price of Rs21 per share to partly repay its long-term debt of Rs4bn acquired in recent years for capacity expansion. Mr Godil explained, “The total local market size is Rs80-100bn, depending on the dollar value, and we expect an annual growth of 7-8pc in the usage of flexible packaging films by food companies in the country. We want to work on a complete import substitution by helping and supporting the downstream industry in Pakistan, which can easily be produced locally, saving around $25m annually.” The company offers a diverse portfolio of packaging solutions, producing Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene, Cast Polypropylene, and Biaxially Oriented Poly-Ethylene Terephthalate films. It is the first group in Pakistan to provide one-window flexible packaging solutions. According to him, the flexible film packaging industry in general, and his company in particular, are working extensively to encourage investment in recycling flexible packaging films. Likewise, National Foods’ new manufacturing facility, part of the company’s plan to reduce the nation’s reliance on imported raw materials through its ‘Seed To Table’ initiative launched in partnership with progressive farm-managing companies, will help it cater to the domestic market, significantly increase its export volume, and create over 600 jobs. “We have launched our ‘Seed to Table’ initiative to reduce the country’s dependency on imported raw materials, particularly the annual import of tomato paste amounting to $10m.” He says the tomato project results have exceeded his expectations, and his company intends to double the acreage to 1,000 acres next year. He says the same model will now be replicated with other key ingredients like red chillies, further strengthening domestic agriculture and reducing reliance on imports. Pakistan produces approximately 144,000 tonnes of red chillies annually, yet over 20,000 tonnes have to be imported per year to meet specific industry requirements. “The new production facility is equipped with cutting-edge technology and production capacity of 6000 tonnes/month for production of spices, recipe mixes, ketchup, mayonnaise, Chinese sauces, seasonings and Kasuri Methi,” the company’s global CEO Abrar Hasan told this correspondent at the Pakistan Agriculture Connection Expo & Conference in Lahore. Currently, the food company exports its products to 40 countries across five continents. It has subsidiaries in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and North America and has recently expanded its supply chain to Canada. Regarding hurdles in increasing processed food exports, Abrar Hasan notes that Pakistani companies could not expand their presence in the international export markets because of various issues, including restrictions on their investments abroad. “Our dilemma is the same one that is being faced by the country: the dollar crunch. Companies must invest abroad to ensure their presence in foreign markets and boost their exports. But the State Bank doesn’t allow you to invest abroad because we do not have dollars for that. “Strangely enough, individuals have greater and freer access to foreign exchange than the corporates. The exporters are allowed to retain 10pc and invest 10pc of their export revenues, and this facility is available only to the existing exporters for setting up their shop outside the country. “This amount is not enough to make your presence felt in the foreign markets. This also means that a new investor who wants to venture into the export market cannot do so because they don’t have foreign exchange,” he says. He believes that the country’s exports cannot increase unless foreign exchange is freely available to companies. “We export our products through distributors sitting in foreign markets. But this model isn’t very successful. If we want to boost our exports and display our products on large supermarkets’ shelves, we need fulfilment centres and warehouses in those markets,” Hasan argues. According to him, the effort to raise exports requires companies like this to invest in raw material supply and the forward distribution chain in foreign markets. “That is the only way of guaranteeing the quality of products according to international standards and ensuring a continuous, uninterrupted supply to the international buyers,” he urges.

Meanwhile, low-income developing countries have made progress, with the average tax-to-GDP ratios increasing by about 3.5 percentage points since the early 1990s to 13.8 per cent in 2020. The World Bank committed $103m in 2004 to a tax administration reform project. However, according to their website, an independent evaluation rating in 2012 showed the outcome to be unsatisfactory. Another World Bank program with a commitment of $350m was approved in December 2023, but it has also made no progress. Pakistan could increase its tax-to-GDP ratio without foreign assistance via Nadra’s stores of information, and an honest will to improve Tax collections grew by just 4pc in real terms — adjusted for inflation — during five years from FY18 to FY23 at an annual average of just 0.81pc. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell from 10.4pc in 2017-18 to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc. The shocking lack of progress is mystifying for a country that has gone to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) a record number of 24 times and received millions of dollars from the World Bank to reform its tax administration. Is it incompetence, lack of intent, or a combination of both? As a first step toward reforming the tax system, the government should entrust the job of policymaking tax and regulation to a separate body of public finance specialists, and the role of the generalists in the FBR should be limited to execution and operating matters. Many countries have benefited from the experience of East Asian countries and followed their policies. Some key features of successful reform programmes include subjecting the discretionary powers of the tax authorities to legislative oversight and legal checks and balances, reducing the overall number of taxes to a few, and slashing maximum rates, as high rates have historically encouraged tax evasion. Moreover, rebates, exemptions and special treatments are eliminated or reduced, and finally, tax administration is simplified using technology. According to a World Bank study published in 2020, improvements in the tax administration of over a 100 countries were largely driven by technological advances, specifically the implementation of electronic filing and payment systems. In 2004, only 43 economies had an online system for filing and paying taxes. Fifteen years later, more than twice as many did. Developing countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia started using technology to improve their tax collection as early as 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively. Pakistan does not need McKinsey to help automate the FBR’s tax collection. The firm, though widely known for its management consulting practice, can hardly claim technology as its core competence. According to reports published by The New York Times, The Economist, and other respected international papers, McKinsey has been involved in numerous corruption scandals, questionable practices, and lawsuits related to insider trading from the United States (US) to South Africa. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) has a wealth of experience and technological expertise to help FBR automate its systems. It can get help, if needed, from technology companies who have experience doing similar projects in other Asian countries. Pakistan needs to introduce an integrated digital system through which records of interest and dividend payments made by financial institutions to companies and individuals would be linked to the tax system. This is a widely followed international norm. To introduce a digital tax regime, the National Tax Number (NTN) should be the same as the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) number of individuals without requiring the individuals to register. NTN/CNIC should be linked to the financial system through technology, as is the practice in the US, UK, Canada, Singapore, and many other countries. At the end of every year, all interest or dividend-paying institutions must communicate the total payment (interest and dividend) made to each recipient, including tax withheld, to the tax authority with the NTN as the reference. To ensure that the financial institutions have correct and valid mailing addresses, over-the-counter delivery of chequebooks or debit cards or any such payment instrument should not be allowed. This delivery must take place through the post. This small but critical detail would ensure that the addresses are correct. Proof of address is now a common requirement of banks worldwide to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. All individuals with income greater than the minimum exemption limit should be required to file tax returns and include the details of interest and dividend payments received from the financial institutions. Since these details would have already been communicated by the financial institutions to the FBR, there would be no question of inaccurate reporting. This single step, if properly implemented, would instantly expand the tax net. All tax assessments and correspondence should be available to the income tax filers online through a central portal maintained by the FBR. The FBR should communicate through post or electronic means, and no physical presence of tax filers should be required except in the event of a legal case. These simple but critical measures can dramatically increase tax collections and reduce corruption. Pakistan has nearly 177m bank accounts and around 165m mobile phone users. There is no reason why Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio cannot be increased to catch up with that of other Asian countries in a matter of a few years. This has been done in so many countries. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, just the will and intention to execute.

It all starts at home! Exactly, mothers and sons share a powerful bond that goes a very long way in shaping the kind of men they become. It is a special connection like no other! This bond helps shape who a boy grows up to be. A mother’s love and guidance show her son how to be caring and understanding, which helps him build strong relationships throughout his life. A mother becomes a living example of respect and kindness in his life. The way she interacts with everyone, but particularly the men in her life, sets the standard for his son’s behaviour with all the women young or old in his life. By expecting courtesy and consideration, she subtly teaches him that women deserve the same treatment — not as something special, but as fellow human beings. While some mothers show their love with lots of hugs and kisses, that wasn’t exactly my mum’s style. She was more on the strict and disciplined side, therefore, expressing her feelings with words wasn’t always easy for her. However, I never doubted her love. It shone in her eyes — I was her pride and joy. Unlike my dad, mum took charge of making sure things ran smoothly and she was the one who enforced the rules. From a young age, she made sure I knew what was expected of me, both at home and out in the world. Her goal was clear: to raise me into a disciplined, respectful young man who protected others, especially girls in the family and those around me, she made me the one who could go out in the world with kindness and empathy in his heart. However, as time passed, I realised that the rules set by my mother were never illogical or impulsive. They showed how much she cared about me and wanted me to be a strong, capable, responsible and disciplined person. Even though I didn’t like when she suddenly showed her strictness to me, I realise now, it was her way of making me better and stronger for the future. We definitely had our moments, but all those rules and lectures from mum were totally worth it! They made me who I am, and I’m happy with that! There is no doubt that while growing up, most of us, boys and girls, hung out with our mother more than Dad (especially if she happens to be a stay-at-home one). This builds a stronger bond, don’t you think so? Like, you come home from school and who’s there asking a million questions about your day? Your mother, of course! Plus, she’s always dropping wisdom bombs on you, casually, at dinner, or while you’re helping out in the kitchen that very few of us could understand. And as far as I can remember, those wisdom bombs were mostly about respect — respect for myself, respect for others and, most importantly, respect for women. She instilled in me gender equality and the inherent worth of every human being, regardless of their gender. There is no doubt that my father was there to show me the world from a male perspective, but my mother showed me the tenderness and the emotional depth of everything that I missed or failed to notice as a male. While my father taught me strength and resilience, my mother added lessons about emotional expression and the ability to connect with others on a human level. Thanks to her, I’m not just a walking brick wall — I can understand others and express my emotions, too! Boys may not always express their sensitivity or emotions openly; they tend to keep them bottled up inside. Despite being hurt or upset; they often feel pressure not to show it because of societal expectations about masculinity. I consider myself fortunate because my mother understood this. She recognised the turmoil I was experiencing inside, the façade I tried to keep as I grew up. I remember back in my childhood days, one day I came home from school feeling upset because a classmate had teased me during recess. My face was all red in anger, I ran straight to my mum. Instead of immediately solving the problem, she let me express my feelings fully. Once I had calmed down, she said, “I know it hurts when someone is unkind, but your reaction shows you have a tender heart. That tenderness allows you to understand how others feel.” She gently wiped my tears and continued, “Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about having empathy. It’s a gift that will help you form deep connections in life.” My mother taught me that tenderness and emotional depth are strengths, not weaknesses. From her, I learned to appreciate my ability to feel deeply instead of suppressing it. It also helped me become more emotionally aware and in tune with myself and my other siblings. Now that I am an adult, I carry the legacy of my mother’s teachings like a precious torch, lighting up my path wherever I go. Many kids and youngsters don’t like when their parents give them instructions or tell them to follow the rules, but I accepted and followed. Whether it was making my bed every morning or completing my homework before playtime, my mother’s insistence on discipline taught me responsibility and time management. Yes, undoubtedly, there were also times when I grumbled and protested, but all grown up now, I realise that those small tasks laid the foundation for success in all areas of my life. My mother is not in my life anymore, and I long to feel the comfort of her touch one more time. I long to hear her words of encouragement and wisdom once more. But you can express and cherish the presence of your parents in your life. Waste no minute, because we are the joy of our parents. Knowing that we care about them gives them strength and happiness. Therefore, even as adults, it’s crucial to express our love and care for our parents. Both mother and father hold a special place in our lives. They need to be acknowledged and appreciated. I admit, as kids, teens and even adults, we can be selfish, often prioritising our desires without considering our parents’ feelings. There are occasions when we may prioritise our father, but we tend to take our mother for granted. Why? Because we believe she will never mind, always forgive and easily forget. Isn’t it an injustice? Remember kids, our mother is the one who knows us from the core of our hearts, our good and bad, our strengths and weaknesses, because she was the one who gave us birth. She held us carefully and gently in her arms, remained up all night to comfort us when we cried for hours, and her tired, restless body with pure love kept trying to soothe and give us comfort forgetting all about her in providing us. Dear mother, sometimes I wish I could rewind life. There’s so much I’d tell you. First and foremost, how much your love means to me. You were my guide, teaching me right from wrong, even when it meant sacrificing your own comfort. All those late nights, all the things you gave up — they built the foundation of who I am today. And for that, I can’t thank you enough. There’s a part of me that aches knowing I never truly expressed how grateful I was for your endless prayers, and whispered wishes for my happiness that echoed through the years. Because of you, mother, a part of me will always believe I can achieve anything. Thanks for whispering that into my heart all through the years.

Startled you with my letter, right? And you are wondering what on earth has made me write a letter when I could have simply messaged you or called you up. And I know, fumbling with anxiety, you have checked your phone by now to see if you had missed my calls or messages. So let me assure you, everything is fine Maa, please do not fret. And keep reading this. You know, this time I wanted to do something really special for you on Mother’s Day. First, I thought of gifting you those emerald earrings you longed to have, the ones whose picture you have saved in your phone’s gallery for ages. Or buy you a pair of comfy shoes that will help you walk around, doing the household chores easily. But then I realised that these materialistic things will not reveal my love for you until I express it myself. Let me put it straight — for me, Mother’s Day is not meant to be celebrated on only one day of the year, every day is Mother’s Day.  How? Because I cannot imagine a day without your presence. The very thought of life without you makes my heart skip a beat. My day kick-starts when each morning you wake me up for the Fajr prayers and I see warmth, wisdom and love emanating from your beautiful countenance. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. On days when the worries of tomorrow overwhelm me and make it impossible for me to climb out of bed, your counseling helps me rise and muster up the strength to combat the challenges of the world. You are not only my mother, but you are also my best friend, my North Star and my greatest motivator. When the hardships of my life seem to be unbearable, it’s in your arms that I find solace. When I am all lost and unable to make a decision, your words of wisdom show me the direction and help me stay focused. When situations get tough and I am on the verge of giving up, it’s your constant reminders to remain steadfast and have strong faith in the Almighty, that prevents me from relinquishing my objectives. Above all, you are my greatest well-wisher. After scooping accolades, when I return home all elated and brimming with joy, you are the first one to embrace me and rejoice at my success. As I sit at my desk, penning down my sentiments, I can’t help recalling the love and devotion with which you have taught me when I was little. The patience and dedication with which you have coached me have not only helped me soar in my academics, but also in all the endeavours of my life. The values and morals you have instilled in me have guided me, helped me distinguish between right and wrong, and have thus shaped my entire personality. The greatest achievement for me is when people praise me for taking after you, and I am all the more grateful to Allah for blessing me with such an amazing mother. You have always been my true protector and guide, ever since my birth. How can I not recount the numerous sleepless nights you’ve spent by my bed, praying for my health whenever I have fallen ill, or the anxiousness with which you have waited for me, after school and outside the examination halls? The most incredible part is that though this little daughter of yours is now a grown-up, your love for her has not faded away, instead it has amplified. Even today, I can see the anxiousness in your eyes when I am late from work, can feel the worry in your voice when I am unable to respond to your calls, and can discern your endearment when you cook delectable food items, especially for me. Maa, you have been a saviour throughout the ebbs and flows of my life’s struggles. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. Whether I needed a shoulder to cry on or a friend to confide in, an expert to offer me advice, or a buddy to celebrate my minuscule accomplishments, Maa, you have executed all these roles, flawlessly! I know no matter how hard I try, I can never be able to repay you for the amount of sacrifices you have made for me and for the unfaltering care, support and unconditional love you have showered on me. Nevertheless, with utmost gratitude, I pray to the Almighty Allah to bless you with abundant health and happiness, today and always. Ameen Happy Mother’s Day, Maa! Love you to the moon and back!\nYour ever-loving daughter. Published in Dawn, Young World, May 11th, 2024 Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.

According to meteorological forecasts, the precipitation in the Anhui region during this summer is expected to increase by 50 to 80 percent compared to the usual levels. The possible extreme rainfall-induced floods pose a great threat to the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute is utilizing digital tools and other technical expertise to carry out flood prevention and the maintenance of power grid equipment. On Thursday, at the inspection site of the Yungu 220 KV transformer substation in Hefei, Anhui province, maintenance personnel inspected goods and materials regarding flood prevention and uploaded related information. Technical staff members from the institute conducted statistical analysis of all units through the Anhui power grid disaster prevention platform. Those efforts provided robust support for power grid flood prevention. Power grid flood warning and prediction is a data-intensive task, and the institute is actively advancing the collection and integration of data in need. By gathering data from various sources such as the number forecast center, hydrological bureaus and meteorological departments, an intelligent algorithm system for warning of floods and geological disasters is being constructed. Through the use of data and positioning systems, disaster warnings of particular stations or lines can be achieved. Real-time risk prediction can be sent to front lines through the platform to help initiate flood prevention emergency responses, organize patrols and ensure timely access to flood information. Based on the inspection operation app, maintenance personnel can conduct inspections of low-lying substations, ground wire station buildings, foundational waterlogged poles or towers and other power grid facilities. All flood prevention risk information can be found at the disaster prevention platform. Utilizing digital methods to monitor and control the progress of risk management, they have achieved a full-process control from risk identification, to formulation of risk management plans and finally to the elimination of the risks. Additionally, based on the distribution of risks, a refined scheduling of flood prevention can be organized. Combining historical data on floods, flood-prone areas, and other relevant information, technical personnel from the institute utilized the disaster prevention platform to analyze high-risk power grid equipment in flood-prone areas. Innovative technologies such as three-eye cameras, videos and the precise monitoring of water levels within stations were employed to accurately monitor water levels. Furthermore, drone inspections and shared tower videos were utilized to achieve precise disaster monitoring across all areas at all time. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute, in line with the requirements of digital transformation in power grid flood prevention, has established a digital control system for power grid flood prevention processes. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by power grid flood prevention work in areas such as prediction, material transportation and on-site inspections during flood seasons. It enhanced the prediction and warning capabilities, promoted the usage of digital tools, and supports the digital transformation of the company. Copyright 1995 -  . All rights reserved.

The world body approved the Arab and Palestinian-sponsored resolution by a vote of 143-9 with 25 abstentions. It is Israel\'s relentless military offensive in Gaza since Oct 7 that has prompted more UN members to join the pro-Palestine group. A UN General Assembly resolution on Oct 27 calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza was approved 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Although the US can still veto Palestine\'s UN membership in the UN Security Council voting on the issue as it did on April 18, the result of the latest UN General Assembly vote reflects a wider support for full membership of Palestine in the UN, which means a greater pressure on Washington to act against the will of the world. US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood said on Friday that for the US to support Palestinian statehood, direct negotiations must guarantee Israel\'s security and future as a democratic Jewish state and that Palestinians can live in peace in a state of their own. But by saying that the US side just pretends to be blind to the fact that it is the Israeli side that has been recklessly killing the Palestinian people on their land. And even if the Hamas Oct 7 attack is taken into account, what the Israel has done in the region since the World War II must also be borne in mind as well, which clearly shows the right and wrong regarding the Palestinian question. The world can see clearly that the statehood of Israel has not only been fully guaranteed but also the country has prospered. In the process, it has continuously expanded its influences to the Palestinian side beyond the 1967 borders, and even invaded neighboring countries, including Syria and Lebanon. Over the years, Israel, as the occupying power, has technically eroded the foundation of the two-state solution. The current conflict, which has lasted for more than seven months, is more likely to completely ruin the prospects of the two-state solution agreed by the international community. So it is not the security or future of Israeli people that has become a question of grave concern, but that of the Palestinians, whose survival in Gaza has even become a question today thanks to Israel\'s aggression indulged and supported by Washington, not to mention the overdue statehood of their country. That Israel intensified its attack on Rafah on Saturday, under the US\' acquiescence, in response to the UN General Assembly the Palestine-related vote the previous day, presents a grave provocation to the common will of the international community, and also serves to put an end to its peace talks with Hamas in Cairo that has lasted for days, in which Hamas had made big concessions for a ceasefire. Israel should stop its collective punishment of the Gaza people, stop advancing its military offensive in Rafah, and effectively remove all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. In the West Bank, Israel should stop all settlement activities and effectively curb the intensifying settler violence. Palestine should enjoy the same status as Israel, and the Palestinian people should enjoy the same rights as the Israeli people. It is the common responsibility of the international community, including the US, to support and promote the process of Palestinian independent statehood and provide a strong guarantee for the implementation of the two-state solution and the realization of lasting peace in the Middle East. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the US should put aside its own interests and work for world peace and humanity, undertaking its global responsibility. The UN Security Council is a platform to resolve issues and not create divisions or hijack the global peace agenda for one\'s own narrow ends by abusing its veto power. Copyright 1995 -  .

The UN Security Council is a platform to resolve issues and not create divisions or hijack the global peace agenda for one\'s own narrow ends by abusing its veto power. Copyright 1995 -  .
