His family told industry publication Variety that he died on Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, California. "His films were revolutionary and iconoclastic, and captured the spirit of an age," their statement said. Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro are among the actors he helped develop. Directors James Cameron and Martin Scorsese cut their teeth on his films. Many of his films became cult classics and he became famous for the speed at which he worked, often making two films at the same location and at the same time, in order to save money. Roger Corman was born in Detroit on 5 April 1926. His father, William, was an engineer and he had intended to follow in his footsteps. However, while studying at college, he became attracted to film-making and after a spell working for General Motors quit his job and went to work at 20th Century Fox as a messenger boy. Having failed to make much progress, he set off for Europe where among other things, he briefly studied English literature at Oxford. He returned to the US with ambitions to become a screenwriter. He sold his first script, The House in the Sea, in 1953 and it was filmed as Highway Dragnet the following year with Corman being credited as co-producer. However, he was so upset by the changes made to his story that he scraped together some cash and set himself up as a producer. Corman began directing in 1955 with Swamp Women and over the next 15 years he made more than 50 films, gaining a reputation for the speed with which he could turn them out. It became something of a joke in the film industry that Corman could negotiate a contract from a public phone, shoot the film in the phone box and pay for it with the coins in the change slot. The 1960 release, The Little Shop of Horrors, which featured a brief appearance by a young Jack Nicholson, took just two days to shoot with Corman using the set of a previous film, Bucket of Blood. A stage musical based on the film opened in 1982 and would itself spawn a second film version four years later. Corman decided to widen his horizons with a series of films based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe and featuring Vincent Price as the lead in all but one of them. The House of Usher was released in 1960 and was followed by a string of others including The Raven, The Masque of the Red Death and The Tomb of Ligeia. His 1962 film, The Intruder, which examined racial tensions in America\'s Deep South, featured a young William Shatner and won an award at the Venice Film Festival. Despite this, the film flopped at the box office and became Corman\'s first film to make a loss, prompting him to remark that he\'d stick to making films that entertained rather than carried a social message. For a time he became part of the 1960s counter-culture, making biker film The Wild Angels, which starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra. He also directed The Trip, which was written by and starred Jack Nicholson. The film was seen as the precursor of Easy Rider, with both Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper featuring in the cast In the late 60s he set up his own production company, New World Pictures. As well as continuing to make budget movies, he also began handling films made by distinguished foreign film-makers, including Francois Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini and introducing them to an American audience. He sold New World Pictures in the 1980s but went on to form two more production companies. He also returned to the director\'s chair in 1990 with the film Frankenstein Unbound. Based on a Brian Aldiss novel, it starred John Hurt and Bridget Fonda and featured a brief appearance by Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the Australian band INXS. In 2009 he received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement and continued to work well into his eighties, producing the 2010 films Dinoshark and Sharktopus for the Syfy TV channel. The sheer quantity of films on which he worked is almost without precedent, as was his ability to find and nurture new talent. Many of his films have taken on cult status and few directors have been so successful at making popular pictures on such tight budgets. When asked how Corman would like to be remembered, he said, \'I was a filmmaker, just that,\'" the family said in their statement.

Price, who becomes Walesâ\x80\x99 14th world champion, achieved the feat in just her seventh professional fight in front of a passionate Cardiff crowd at the Utilita Arena. The new WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine welterweight champion, Price could be set for some huge nights ahead in a stacked division with the likes of Natasha Jonas, Sandy Ryan and Mikaela Mayer all now potential future opponents. Price, a 2020 Olympic champion, won every round on the judges\' cards after the ringside medics decided 39-year old American McCaskill could not safely continue. â\x80\x9cThis has got to be up there with winning a gold medal,â\x80\x9d Price said. â\x80\x9cJessica McCaskill is a credit to the sport, but this was my night. â\x80\x9cI want to create a legacy and I honestly believe this is just the start. It took me a couple of rounds to find my rhythm, it was a tough fightâ\x80¦ but I enjoyed myself in there tonight. â\x80\x9cI am only going to get better. I am still learning.â\x80\x9d Price, also a former kickboxing world champion and international footballer, had made clear she felt she belonged on the biggest stage after being catapulted into the limelight in just her seventh paid fight. Fighting a mere 14 miles or so from her home town of Ystrad Mynach, Price was looking to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Joe Calzaghe, Enzo Maccarinelli and current world champion Joe Cordina who have all enjoyed winning nights in the Cardiff Arena. Cordina, who has twice won world titles in the Welsh capital, had implored Price to enjoy her moment being centre stage, warning that she might never again enjoy the chance to fight in front of her home fans. Price, who fought all over the world as an amateur, had never boxed professionally in Wales and the event, broadcast live on BBC Wales as the broadcaster showed a world title fight for the first time in 19 years, had a distinctly Welsh flavour. The 29-year old entered the ring to the Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd â\x80\x93 perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with more than 50 Wales football caps - with former Welsh world champions Maccarinelli, Lee Selby, Steve Robinson and Barry Jones all in attendance at ringside. Lauren Price became world champion in just her seventh professional fight This was unquestionably the biggest night of Priceâ\x80\x99s professional career but she showed no signs of nerves as she sensibly looked to create space and distance against a fighter renowned for ploughing forward on the front foot. A cagey first session saw Price land the slightly cleaner shots, keeping her composure as she landed with a flurry of punches at the end of round two. McCaskill is a fighter who never takes a backward step but Price worked behind her jab and used her speed and movement to tag the American with a series of eye-catching shots. The Detroit fighter was warned for holding and pushing in the third round and she struggled to deal with Priceâ\x80\x99s relentless pace, with the Welsh boxer looking far more experienced than her six pro fight resume. Price and McCaskill had an accidental clash of heads in the fifth round that left huge swelling around McCaskillâ\x80\x99s left eye as the home fighter began to take control. Price, who dedicated her win to her grandmother Linda and late grandfather Derek, who raised her, says she wants to create a legacy for Welsh womenâ\x80\x99s boxing and winning her first world title is the first step. A unique athlete who wrote in a school letter aged just eight that she wanted to be a world kickboxing champion, international footballer and Olympian, Price is used to chasing her dreams and has become a world champion just 23 months after making her professional debut. The Rob McCracken-trained fighter had vowed that she would not allow McCaskill to turn the contest into a â\x80\x9cdogfightâ\x80\x9d and was true to her word as she used her superior defensive acumen and speed to dominate from start to finish. McCaskillâ\x80\x99s corner were having to work overtime to deal with the swelling above her left eye, with the American flying out of her corner in the sixth session in search of the one big punch she felt could stop the fight in an instant. However, Price was too composed to deviate from the gameplan and she continued to land the more telling blows as she continually tagged the champion on the inside before dancing out of reach. The latter rounds became far more attritional for Price with McCaskill desperately swinging haymakers as she looked for the one punch that could change the course of the fight and ensure she kept her titles. The fight was halted after Jessica McCaskill\'s eye was assessed by the ringside medic for a second time However, the damage to McCaskillâ\x80\x99s eye was too great with the ringside medic deciding at the start of round nine that McCaskill was unable to continue. â\x80\x9cBoxing has a new superstar,â\x80\x9d Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom said. Priceâ\x80\x99s trainer McCracken added that Price had done â\x80\x9cbrilliantly well,â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cis a credit to Wales". On the undercard, featherweight Rhys Edwards underlined his credentials as his undefeated record continued with a unanimous and clear points victory over experienced opponent Thomas Patrick Ward. Edwards is now 16-0 and won the WBA intercontinental title as he produced an eye-catchingly impressive display in front of his home fans. Edwardsâ\x80\x99 stablemates Kyran Jones and Kane Shepherd were also victorious, with Jones beating fellow Welshman Lewis Howells on points while Shepherd beat Ismael Ellis whose corner retired their fighter after a one-sided contest including a knockdown. There were also wins for heavyweights Moses Jolly and Hughie Fury, while Mark Jeffers knocked out Darren Johnstone in a middleweight contest, with Johnstone receiving oxygen in the ring. \'Generational talent\' Price ready to seize \'superstar\' moment \'Special athlete with a secret weapon\' - Price targets world title The Welsh boxer with enough siblings for a football team BBC Wales was given exclusive access to the Price camp in the days before the fight.

The heavy defeat followed a 4-2 opening loss to reigning champions Canada in the Czech Republic on Saturday. GB trailed Finland by a single goal after the opening period but conceded five in the second and another two in the third.

The Motorsport Ireland driver was pipped to victory by Spain\'s Jan Solans by a margin of just 3.2 seconds. McErlean, 24, was faster than Solans in a final stage shootout but came up just short of victory. "An incredible experience," said TokSport Skoda driver McErlean. "We have our first WRC2 podium, and no finer man to have beside me than James Fulton [McErlean\'s co-driver]. "Thanks to TokSport and Skoda for a great car but most of all, thank you to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy for always believing in me." McErlean, who was making his first WRC start of the season for TokSport Skoda, had swapped the lead with Solans on several occasions throughout the rally. The 24-year-old led by 0.1 seconds with two stages remaining, but Solans hit back and was fastest by 6.5 seconds on the penultimate stage. McErlean posted the fastest time on the final run by 3.2 seconds, but fell short of a first win by the same margin. Solans and McErlean had capitalised on accidents from experienced leaders Oliver Solberg and Gus Greensmith earlier in the event but, in truth, the pair showed great speed throughout the rally and were deserving of podium finishes. McErlean\'s performance was enough to finish ninth overall in the rally, which was won by the Rally1 machine of Sebastien Ogier. There was misfortune for Northern Ireland\'s William Creighton and Kris Meeke, who both retired on Saturday. Junior WRC champion Creighton restarted to finish the rally in 12th place in WRC2. Josh McErlean\'s first WRC2 podium feels like it had been a long time coming. He has long been tipped to challenge at the front, but Rally Portugal was a coming-of-age performance when he kept a cool head and highlighted blistering pace, while many more experienced rivals faltered. The switch from Hyundai to Skoda has already paid off and he starts his WRC2 in style, and his confidence will only grow from here. A lot was made of Motorsport Ireland\'s failed bid to secure a round of the World Rally Championship, due to a failure to get government funding - something the Rally Northern Ireland bid knows all too well - but its academy drivers show the island of Ireland has a lot to offer the world stage after the passing of the late, great Craig Breen. McErlean\'s podium was also a poignant moment, as the 24-year-old had been mentored by Breen, who was also navigated by Fulton before his passing. Fellow academy driver William Creighton is making good progress in the WRC2 class after taking the Junior WRC title last year, and Motorsport Ireland-backed drivers Jon Armstrong and Aoife Raftery are also impressing in the European championship.

He made the remarks at a pre-budget conference in Lahore, two days after  Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government would limit its business only to strategic and essential SOEs under its domain but their number would be reduced from 40 after scrutiny. Chairing the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) meeting, which was attended by the finance minister, Dar said privatisation of loss-making SOEs would be a priority. The meeting noted that 40 SOEs were currently categorised as strategic or essential, but respective ministries would submit their details to the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOE). The CCoSOE will determine the status of the SOEs to be categorised as strategic or essential entities. Speaking on Sunday, Aurangzeb said: “There is no such as [a] strategic SOE.” Talking about the meeting chaired by Dar on Friday, he continued, “We are absolutely on the same wavelength — that there is no such thing as a strategic SOE.” The finance minister said that a meeting would be held tomorrow where “we will go back to various ministries and say that all this should be handed over to the private sector”. “There will be public-private partnership and we will accelerate the privatisation agenda,” he said. Commenting on concerns regarding the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Aurangzeb said the government was not just looking at foreign investors. “They are local and foreign investors who are bidding […] there is no such thing that we are only looking at foreign investors,” he said. Commenting on a fresh loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, he said that a larger and longer programme was needed to bring “permanence in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms”. He also talked about energy reforms, saying that there were “leakages” and stressed the need for stopping theft. He said that changes were being brought to the boards of distribution companies (Discos) in order to bring in those from the private sector for “better corporate governance”. “And then you will see how we bring those Discos towards concessions or privatisation or a combination of both,” he emphasised.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Esther Perez Ruiz, the Fund’s resident representative for Pakistan, said: “A mission team led by Nathan Porter, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan, will meet with authorities next week to discuss the next phase of engagement. “The aim is to lay the foundation for better governance and stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economic growth that will benefit all Pakistanis,” she added. Pakistan last month completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but the government has stressed the need for a fresh, longer-term programme. Last week, the Fund said that a mission was expected to visit Pakistan this month to “discuss the FY25 budget, policies, and reforms under a potential new programme for the welfare of all Pakistanis”. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the $350bn economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. On Friday, the Fund said that downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the IMF in its staff report following the second and final review under the standby agreement. The Fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements. Additional input from Reuters Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.

AJK witnessed violent clashes between the police and activists of a rights movement amid a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the territory on Friday and Saturday, which left at least one police official dead and more than 90 others injured, officials told Dawn.com on Saturday. Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali had said that Sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest in the town of Islamgarh, where he was deployed to stop a rally for Muzaffarabad under the banner of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC). The JAAC, which has traders at the forefront in most parts of the state, has been seeking the provision of electricity as per hydropower generation cost in AJK, subsidised wheat flour and an end to the privileges of the elite class. They called for the strike following the arrest of at least 70 of their members in raids on Thursday. Reports emerged in the wake of the protests on Sunday that three Rangers battalions had entered the territory through Kohala and were awaiting further orders. However, AJK Minister for Rural Development Faisal Mumtaz Rathore confirmed that the Rangers, due to the intervention of President Asif Zardari, were “called back as soon as they entered Azad Kashmir” since the situation had calmed down. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, former prime minister of AJK Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi slammed the deployment, calling it a “drama” and an attempt to score political points. “First they send them, then call them back, what is this?” the ex-AJK PM said. “Those fighting for their rights and engaging in protest are free to do so, but they must remain peaceful,” Niazi said in a press conference. He added that they (the protestors) must not give the “enemy” a chance to sow discord within the territory and create infighting. In a post on Facebook, Rathore acknowledged the public demands for cheap electricity, but admitted that addressing them was “out of his hands”. “The big demand of the people, the demand for cheap electricity and the end of loadshedding, falls under the jurisdiction of the Government of Pakistan,” Rathore said. Urging the public to remain peaceful, he said, “In this one year [I have been in office], I have never been against the right to peaceful protest and [never] supported violence against people.” In the aftermath of the protests, JAAC leader Shaukat Nawaz Mir reiterated that the committee is a peaceful organisation and willing to negotiate with the authorities to ensure the provision of cheap electricity and cheap flour. He also appreciated the withdrawal of the Rangers from the area. “We have planned another shutter-down strike,” he told reporters on Sunday. “We have been peaceful for the last year and always will be a peaceful movement. This territory and its institutions and police are our own.” Mir maintained that the JAAC is advocating for the rights of the public in AJK, “but it is the bureaucrats who do not understand the public’s needs that are doing the damage”. The JAAC is peaceful and open to negotiations, Mir added, requesting to be notified by the authorities about decisions taken. “We do not want to hurt anyone.” He also slammed the federal government for not cutting down spending while at the same time claiming they have no room in the budget to subsidise electricity or flour. “The government claims they can’t provide cheap electricity and flour because they have no budget, but they have the money for watches and cars,” Mir said, adding that the federal government and the prime minister should be “ashamed”. “I don’t want my forum to be controversial,” Mir said. “We are made up of respectable politicians … the local council is standing with us”. The JAAC leader added that the movement was successful since members of multiple parties and councils “are on our side”. “Our nation is conscious now. There is no politics here, we just want our rights and identity.” Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

As he met players of the men’s national team in the Irish capital of Dublin, the PCB quoted him as saying: “Fight till the last ball; the competition should be apparent.” On Friday, Ireland recorded their maiden T20 win against Pakistan who could not defend a solid-looking 182-5 after being put in to bat first, dealing a shocking blow to the Babar Azam-led side’s preparations for the World Cup, which is taking place next month in the United States. The loss to Ireland, who are in Pakistan’s group in the T20 World Cup, came after a series draw on home soil to a New Zealand squad missing most of their first-choice players. With Babar only recently reinstated as captain, it was another bump in the road for their tournament preparation. Today’s match will start at 7pm, with Ireland leading the series by 1-0. In a post on X, the PCB shared a video of Naqvi meeting the Green Shirts and speaking to them, adding that a detailed discussion on the action plan took place during the two-hour-long meetup. Encouraging the team, the PCB chairman urged the players to play with hard work, passion and a “professional approach”. He noted that T20 cricket needed a unique and aggressive approach, adding that victory was only possible if cricket was played in a “modern manner”. “An action plan can be formulated while sitting in a room but the real test is on the ground, where the performance should be visible,” the PCB quoted him as telling the team. Naqvi praised all players as “undoubtedly talented, professional and the best”, adding that the team’s bowling attack was “splendid”. However, he emphasised that great attention was required when fielding so that the opponent “cannot get any chance” to score. “The players are the hope for Pakistan and you have to meet the nation’s expectations. Teamwork is the fundamental thing for victory,” the PCB chairman said. He noted that the public loved cricket and had expectations from the team. Naqvi said that success would come if all 11 of the players in the team performed with unity. “No one is accepting the loss in the first match against Ireland. The real test after Ireland and England is the World Cup,” he added. Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said Israeli airstrikes pounded parts of northern, central and southern Gaza during the night and into Sunday morning. In Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city which sits on the Egyptian border, the Kuwaiti hospital said on Sunday it had received the bodies of “18 martyrs” killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported at least two fatalities, a father and son, both doctors, in a strike on Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Mourners react next to the body of a Palestinian killed in Israeli strikes at Al-Aqsa hospital, in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip on May 12. — Reuters A full-scale Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah “cannot take place”, the UN human rights chief insisted, saying it could not be reconciled with international law, AFP reports. “The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!” Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement. “These exhausted, famished people, many of whom have been displaced many times already, have no good options. He said a full-scale offensive could have a “catastrophic impact […] including the possibility of further atrocity crimes.” “I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.” Volker said he was deeply distressed by fast-deteriorating conditions in Gaza, saying the latest evacuation orders had triggered “massive displacement of an already profoundly traumatised population”. He said the towns supposed to receive those displaced from Rafah had already been “reduced to rubble”. Turk also voiced concern at reports of indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza.\nHe said a full-scale offensive on Rafah “cannot take place” and called on all states with influence to do everything in their power to prevent it. He also called on Israel and Palestinian armed groups to agree on a ceasefire, and for all hostages to be released immediately. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned Israel against expanding its military operations to Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “We consider an offensive on Rafah […] to be irresponsible,” Scholz said on a talk show organised by the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group in Potsdam just outside Berlin. “We warn against this, and we do not believe that there is any concept that will ultimately lead to this happening without incredible human losses in terms of innocent civilians,” he said. The German chancellor added that humanitarian aid must also be brought to Gaza, and there must be a perspective for peaceful coexistence in which two states can exist side by side. The health ministry in Gaza said that at least 35,034 people have been killed in the territory during more than seven months of Israeli bombardment, AFP reports. The toll includes at least 63 deaths over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,755 people have been wounded in the Gaza Strip since October 7. Months after Israel said it had dismantled Hamas’ command structure in northern Gaza — devastated by intense violence in the early stages of the offensive — fighting has resumed in recent days in Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City’s Zeitun neighbourhood. AFP correspondents reported intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters in the Zeitun area early on Sunday, with medics and witnesses saying troops were engaged in combat in Zeitun as well as Jabalia. A displaced Palestinian woman, who fled Jabalia after the Israeli military called on residents to evacuate, carries her belongings on her head as she makes her way towards Gaza City on May 12. — Reuters Britain’s foreign minister David Cameron has said Israel should not carry out an offensive in the Gazan city of Rafah without a “clear plan” to protect people, AFP reports. “For there to be a major offensive in Rafah, there would have to be an absolutely clear plan about how you save lives, how you move people out the way, how you make sure they’re fed, you make sure that they have medicine and shelter and everything,” he told Sky News television. “We have seen no such plan … so we don’t support an offensive in that way,” he added. Cameron said Israel needed to “do better” in allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. “I’ve said many times that I’m not content with the action Israel has taken over humanitarian aid,” he said, adding there are “some signs” of improvement, “but not fast enough”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged an immediate halt to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, the return of hostages and a “surge” in humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “I repeat my call, the world’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages and an immediate surge in humanitarian aid,” Guterres said in a video address to an international donors’ conference in Kuwait. “But a ceasefire will only be the start. It will be a long road back from the devastation and trauma of this war”, he added. “The war in Gaza is causing horrific human suffering, devastating lives, tearing families apart and rendering huge numbers of people homeless, hungry and traumatised,” Guterres said. His remarks were played at the opening of the conference in Kuwait organised by the International Islamic Charitable Organisation (IICO) and the UN’s humanitarian coordination organisation OCHA. In the course of the past 24 hours, there is clear pressure being exerted by the Israeli military on three fronts inside the Gaza Strip, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reports from Deir Al Balah. They have been maximising pressure on Rafah, the middle area as well as the north of the territory, he says, highlighting that the Israeli military has passed an evacuation order for residents of the Jabalia refugee camp and in the central areas of Rafah. The Israeli military has started to intensify the bombardment of the Jabalia camp in the past couple of hours, destroying residential houses and attacking evacuation centres, the report said. They say they are trying to completely eliminate Hamas battalions there despite a previous announcement that said they had managed to take military control in the north of this Strip, it added. Smoke billows during Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip from a position in southern Israel on May 12. — AFP Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram has asserted that the adoption of a resolution advocating Palestine’s full membership in the United Nations by a large majority would ramp up political pressure on the United States to reassess its position within the Security Council. The UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on Friday with 143 votes. The US and eight other countries voted against the resolution, while 25 abstained. Three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — China, France, and Russia — voted for the resolution. Britain abstained. Among US allies, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Spain, and Mexico voted for the resolution, while Germany and Canada abstained. All South Asian nations — Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan — voted in favour. Almost all Arab and other Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, also voted for the resolution. Read more here. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Imad Abu Zayda, an emergency doctor in Gaza’s Jabalia, said: “No light due to the lack of fuel and there’s no medical supplement available as Israel has expanded their operation in the area. We have no oxygen to give to patients. “Most of the injuries are children and women. We are operating with minimum facilities,” the doctor added. Israel has launched strikes on Gaza after it expanded an evacuation order for Rafah, with AFP correspondents reporting intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters near Gaza City. Witnesses said Israel had carried out strikes in Rafah near the crossing with Egypt on Saturday, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Residents piled water tanks, mattresses and other belongings onto vehicles and prepared to flee again. Residents were told to go to the “humanitarian zone” of Al-Mawasi, on the coast northwest of Rafah. “We don’t know where to go,” said Farid Abu Eida, who was preparing to leave Rafah, having already been displaced there from Gaza City. “There is no place left in Gaza that is safe or not overcrowded… There’s nowhere we can go.” Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said “we have eliminated dozens of terrorists in eastern Rafah” and the army claimed troops were fighting “armed terrorists” at the crossing and had found “numerous underground tunnel shafts”. Gaza’s civil defence agency has said that two doctors were killed in an Israeli air strike on the city of Deir Al Balah in a central area of the Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “The bodies of Doctor Muhammad Nimr Qazaat and his son, Doctor Youssef, were recovered (as they were killed) because of an Israeli raid on the city of Deir Al Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and they were transferred to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah,” the agency said in a statement. The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Music fans who gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday to watch the Eurovision contest decried juries’ snubs of Israel as “obviously political”, AFP reports. The mood was electric at the packed Layla bar in Tel Aviv as the show got underway, with the crowd going wild when Israel’s contestant Eden Golan appeared on screen. As votes started ticking in, and it became clear that few of the juries representing the 37 countries with voting rights were offering Golan even a handful of votes, spirits fell. Fans went from jumping around and waving Israeli flags to sitting downcast, some with their heads in their hands. “This is clearly political,” said Guy, a 20-year-old who declined to give his last name. “Eden was amazing… But there are people who hate us. They don’t see the whole picture,” he told AFP. “We didn’t get much from the countries. That’s obviously a political thing,” Layla manager Tal Shur agreed. Switzerland’s Nemo has won the Eurovision Song Contest, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel’s participation during the conflict in Gaza, AFP reports. Twenty-four-year-old Nemo’s “The Code” won the highest score from nations’ juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden’s Malmo. “I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world,” a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy. Nemo, Baby Lasagna and Israel’s contestant Eden Golan, had been bookmaker favourites to win the competition, watched around the world by millions of lovers of pop music — and kitschy shows. When Golan went on stage to perform her “Hurricane”, both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena. Boos could also be heard while Israel delivered its points to other acts and any time a country gave “Hurricane” high scores. Golan finished fifth with 375 points. This year’s winner Nemo, representing Switzerland, speaks during a press conference after the final of the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) at Malmö Arena, in Malmö, Sweden on May 12. — AFP Israel has hit parts of Gaza including Rafah where it expanded an evacuation order, as the UN warned an outright invasion of the crowded city risked an “epic” disaster, AFP reports. AFP journalists, medics and witnesses reported strikes across the coastal territory, where the UN says humanitarian relief is blocked after Israeli troops defied international opposition and entered eastern Rafah this week. That effectively shut a key aid crossing and suspended traffic through another. At least 21 people were killed during strikes in central Gaza and taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah city, a hospital statement said. Bodies covered in white dust lay on the ground in a courtyard of the facility. A man in a baseball cap leaned over one body bag, clasping a dust-covered hand that protruded. The feet of another corpse poked from under a blanket bearing the picture of a large teddy bear. In Rafah, witnesses reported intense air strikes near the crossing with Egypt, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Other strikes occurred in north Gaza, witnesses said. Hamas has accused Israel of “expanding the incursion into Rafah to include new areas in the centre and the west of the city”. A woman sits next to belongings, as Palestinians prepare to evacuate, after Israeli forces launched a ground and air operation in the eastern part of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on May 11. — Reuters Israel’s military has said that a new field hospital has been established in the central Gaza Strip and is being run by a non-governmental organisation, the International Medical Corp, Reuters reports. “The field hospital will be operated by 150 international medical aid workers and its dozens of beds can be used for emergency and routine medical treatment,” the military said in a statement. The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees has released images of heavily damaged or destroyed schools it runs in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where many Palestinians have been forcibly displaced after the Israeli invasion of Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “The classrooms are torched. Walls are blown out. There is rubble everywhere,” it said, adding there is no real safety or shelter at these schools. “This situation is unfolding under the world’s watch. Enough is enough.” Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the entry of aid into Gaza from the Rafah crossing due to Israel’s “unacceptable escalation”, Egypt’s state-affiliated Alqahera News satellite TV has reported, citing a senior official. Reuters reports the official also said that Egypt held Israel responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the Gaza Strip. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has discussed the dire situation in Gaza with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, with the officials agreeing that a full-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah would have catastrophic consequences and must be prevented, Al Jazeera reports quoting UN read-out. Guterres expressed “deep appreciation for Qatar’s continued mediation efforts to broker a deal for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza and the immediate release of hostages”, the statement added. The Israeli army has said rockets were launched from Rafah in southern Gaza towards the Kerem Shalom crossing, which was temporarily shut earlier this week after deadly fire, AFP reports. “Four launches were identified that crossed from the Rafah area”, the military said in a statement, adding that one rocket was intercepted by Israeli air defences “and the rest fell in open areas” around Kerem Shalom. It added that “no injuries were reported.” Weeks after attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration, Egyptian-American student Layla Sayed received a text message from a friend drawing her attention to a website dedicated to exposing people it says promote hatred of Jews and Israel. “I think they found you from the protest,” the friend wrote. When Sayed visited the site, called Canary Mission, she found a photo from the October 16 rally at the University of Pennsylvania with red arrows pointing to her among the demonstrators. The post included her name, the two cities she lives in, details about her studies and links to her social media accounts. Read more from Reuters here. Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, has released a video of a man held hostage in Gaza and seen alive in the footage, AFP reports. The man is seen speaking in the 11-second clip, which is superimposed with text in Arabic and Hebrew that reads: “Time is running out. Your government is lying”. The health ministry in Gaza has said that at least 34,971 people have been killed in the Palestinian enclave during Israel’s military bombardment in Gaza, AFP reports. The tally includes at least 28 deaths in the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,641 people have been wounded since fighting broke out on October 7. Saheb al-Hams, a hospital director in Rafah, has said that “sadly” the Kuwaiti Specialty Hospital in Rafah city “is now included in the places threatened with evacuation” following Israel’s latest order, Al Jazeera reports. “There is no other place for patients and injured people to go to but this hospital,” al-Hams said in a video message to journalists. The director called for “immediate international protection” for the medical facility. Palestinian Ambassador to the UK Husam Zomlot expressed his appreciation for Harvard students renaming a building after one of his relatives. His wife’s cousin Sidra Hassoun is “one of 14,500 children murdered in Israel’s genocide in Gaza.” In a post on X, he added that he is “proud of these students and all students everywhere” for supporting the Palestinian cause.', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Canada arrests fourth Indian national in killing of Sikh activist - World - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'A fourth Indian national was charged by Canadian authorities on Saturday in the 2023 killing of a separatist Sikh leader in Vancouver. Amandeep Singh, 22, was already being held for unrelated gun charges before being charged with “first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder” in the slaying of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Three other Indian nationals were arrested this month. The killing sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau linked Indian intelligence to the killing. Nijjar — who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 — had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged “terrorism” and conspiracy to commit murder — allegations he denied. He was shot dead on June 18, 2023, by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver. Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had “credible allegations” connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying. India dismissed the allegations as “absurd” and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning. The shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China’s growing influence. US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India’s top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported in April. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two per cent of the country’s population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan.

A powerful solar storm — which could continue into Sunday — has triggered spectacular celestial shows usually confined to the far northern reaches of the planet, hence their nickname of the “northern lights”. “I have the sensation of living through a historic night in France […] It was really charged, with solar particles and emotions,” Eric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Observatoire de Cote d’Azur, wrote on social media after the first night. “Find good spots, away from the lights, with a clear view to the north!” Late on Saturday evening, pictures again started trickling onto social media as people in the United States reported sightings, though not as strong as Friday night’s. The first of several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun —  came just after 4pm GMT on Friday, according to the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). It was later upgraded to an “extreme” geomagnetic storm —  the first since the “Halloween Storms” of October 2003 that caused blackouts in Sweden and damaged power infrastructure in South Africa. Friday’s storm was listed as hitting level five geomagnetic conditions — the highest on the scale. Saturday saw G3 to G5 conditions, with G4 or higher conditions predicted Sunday and G3 conditions possible into Monday. But no major disruptions to power or communications networks appear to have been reported this time around, despite initial worries from authorities. There have only been “preliminary reports of power grid irregularities, degradation to high-frequency communications, GPS and possibly satellite navigation,” the SWPC said. Elon Musk, whose Starlink satellite internet operator has some 5,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, said his satellites were “under a lot of pressure, but holding up so far”. However China’s National Centre for Space Weather issued a “red alert” on Saturday morning, warning the storm will impact communications and navigation in most areas of the country, state news agency Xinhua reported. Auroras were visible in the northern half of the country, according to media reports. Excitement over the phenomenon —  and otherworldly photos of pink, green and purple night skies —  popped up across the world, from Mont Saint-Michel on the French coast to Payette, Idaho — in the western United States — to Australia’s island state of Tasmania. People pose for photos as a geomagnetic storm lights up the night sky above the Bonneville Salt Flats on May 10 in Wendover, Utah. — AFP Unlike solar flares, which travel at the speed of light and reach Earth in around eight minutes, CMEs travel at a more sedate pace, with officials putting the current average at 800 kilometres per second. The CMEs emanated from a massive sunspot cluster that is 17 times wider than our planet. People with eclipse glasses can also look for the sunspot cluster during the day. The Sun is approaching the peak of an 11-year cycle that brings heightened activity. NOAA’s Brent Gordon encouraged the public to try to capture the night sky with phone cameras even if they couldn’t see auroras with their naked eyes. “You’d be amazed at what you see in that picture versus what you see with your eyes.” Fluctuating magnetic fields associated with geomagnetic storms induce currents in long wires, including power lines, which can potentially lead to blackouts. Long pipelines can also become electrified, leading to engineering problems. Spacecraft are also at risk from high doses of radiation, although the atmosphere prevents this from reaching Earth. NASA has a dedicated team looking into astronaut safety and can ask astronauts on the International Space Station to move to places within the outpost that are better shielded. Even pigeons and other species that have internal biological compasses could be affected. Pigeon handlers have noted a reduction in birds coming home during geomagnetic storms, according to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The most powerful geomagnetic storm in recorded history, known as the Carrington Event after British astronomer Richard Carrington, occurred in September 1859.

Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

Spending sleepless nights while tending to children, feeding them, changing diapers, etc. are a part of life of every mother having infants. When the infants grow up a little, the next phase is to educate them, teach them manners and make them learn to be a part of the world out there. It is tough to do all that for me, like every other mother. After all it is not all I have to do. One has to focus on one’s career and household chores at the same time, and fulfil one’s duties towards other family members. Did I mention a “me-time” somewhere in all that I said? I guess not. There is no mentioning of it simply because there is no time left for me while doing all that I do. It is said that you learn about the true value of parents once you have children of your own. I have found this to be exactly true. The sacrifices and unconditional love it takes to be a mother has certainly made me realise the sacrifices my mother made in bringing me up. Looking back at my life, I wish I could change all those moments in my life when, as a child, I misbehaved with my mother. I also wish that I had spent more time with her and made life easier for her. As my children grow up, they seem to become less obedient and respectful. This really hurts. I see this as a general trend in all the children, nowadays. With some exceptions, the older they get, the less respect they show to their mother and elders in general. Having a mind of one’s own is fine, but there cannot be any excuse for bad behaviour towards one’s mother. And also just because your mother is less strict and more friendly than your father, it should not lead you to not show respect to her. Mothers like me do not want our children to be our puppets. All we ask for is recognition of our love and efforts. Expecting respectfulness is a part of that recognition. Every mother would love her child to come up to her and, as a minimum, thank her for her efforts. It would be great if the child could offer to help her in little ways. If nothing else, they should at least not leave any mess for the mother to clean up! Mother’s Day is important, but it is more than just a special day. It is really a reminder that mothers deserve our respect and recognition for their love at all times. For a child to have this realisation certainly means more to mothers than having a card or flowers on Mother’s Day. This is because it means that this realisation would translate into care and respect for one’s mother. For my part, I have started taking care of my mother in all the ways I can. While I do not live with her, I try my best to stay in touch or visit her as much as I can. Taking care of her health and what she wants has become very important for me. It does not matter to me what others do or say about taking care of their mothers. All that matters is what my mother deserves. And that exactly is my message to you all! Do not look at what others do, think of what you can do for your mother, who deserves all the love and respect that one can. Mothers can be your friends too if you learn to share things with her. It is just a misunderstanding that they would not understand you or what you want. You can talk about anything with her: sports, cartoons, TV shows, super heroes, general knowledge, etc. You would be pleasantly surprised when you do end up confiding in her or discussing things with her. I am lucky that I get cards and flowers from my family on Mother’s Day. But many things remain left to be desired on the other 364 days of the year. Still whatever my children do the rest of the year, I would never stop caring for and loving them. I guess that’s what the motherhood is all about. Happy Mother’s Day everyone, but make every day Mother’s Day, for she never fails to make everyday special for her children.

Copyright © 2024, Dawn NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Indian elections - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'THE Islamophobic rhetoric being employed by Narendra Modi for this election campaign has become shrill. Pakistan has nearly always been an electoral issue in India. However, this time, it is Indian Muslims who are bearing the brunt of the Indian prime minister’s hate speech. Speaking in Rajasthan last month, he called Muslims “infiltrators” and said they produce too many children. In Gujarat, where, as chief minister, he had overseen the massacre of Muslims in 2002, he accused the Congress of seeking to “loot” India’s wealth and redistribute it among Muslims, and of organising a ‘vote jihad’ against his leadership. Later, he accused the Congress and Muslims of stealing Hindu wealth and property. Modi’s inflammatory rhetoric was followed by the BJP’s campaign video portraying Muslims as outsiders who plundered India’s wealth. As concerns grew about communal violence, the video was removed. These allegations are a sequel to Modi’s public referencing of earlier conspiracy theories of ‘love jihad’ (Muslims forcibly converting Hindu women and marrying them to increase the Muslim population) or ‘land jihad’ (capturing land to construct religious structures and gaining control of India’s territory). Concerns that his rhetoric might incite further violence against Indian Muslims are increasing. Ordinarily, since Hindus are in a majority in India, it may be difficult to question the rationale of creating a Hindu state. However, two observations are in order. One, the expansionist designs of the cherished Hindu state seek the creation of an Akhand Bharat, a Hindu right fantasy, which would violate the territorial integrity of Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, as per a map displayed in the new parliament building. This is not acceptable to the aforementioned independent states. Two, though the creation of a Hindu state should not translate into discrimination against minorities, regrettably this will be the case. The works of French political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot illustrate how Muslims, 14.5 per cent of India’s population, are grossly underrepresented in bureaucracy, the judiciary, police, and legislative organs. They are second-class citizens. The Muslim-majority area of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmiri is also being subjected to demographic engineering. The destruction of the centuries-old Babri Masjid by Hindu zealots in 1992 and the construction of a temple in its place has set a precedent that might be followed for other historic mosques. This contrasts sharply with the UAE’s gesture of permitting a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. Modi’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is raising concerns of violence. Analysts are also pointing out the fascist tendencies of the BJP regime, a steep decline in democratic values, and a departure from the moorings of pluralism and secularism on which modern India was founded. In her book The Incarcerations, Alpa Shah contends that Modi’s India is using its national security apparatus to incarcerate ordinary citizens for their dissenting views. Commenting on the book, Arundhati Roy stated that this was about criminalisation and incarceration of dissent itself. Strikingly, the Modi regime has also used art and culture to project the Hindutva philosophy. Kunal Purohit’s book H-Pop: The Secretive World of Hindutva Pop Stars shows how Hindutva pop stars and influencers are being used to spread the message of Hindu supremacy and create acceptance of Hindutva’s core beliefs. Apart from this, Modi is playing on his government’s accomplishments: making India the world’s fifth largest economy; the construction of 50,000 kilometres of national highways; boosting India’s mi\xad\xadlitary spending; bu\xad\xadilding Vikrant, In\xad\xaddia’s first domes\xadti\xad\xadcal\xad\xadly built aircraft carrier; and the Chandrayaan-3 moon landing. His prospects of winning a third term have been bolstered by a weak opposition. Despite the formation of the Congress-led 37-party INDIA coalition, there is no real challenge. What has bolstered his outreach is India’s enhanced global standing. In his book Why Bharat Matters, S. Jaishankar presents India as a leader of the global south and makes a case for the rejuvenation of India as a civilisational state. There are some lessons that Pakistan could learn from India’s electoral process. One, despite the large scale of India’s elections (969 million registered voters; 1m polling stations) and the use of electronic voting machines, election results are largely accepted without much ado. Two, there is no caretaker government, as the incumbents become ‘caretakers’ in a way, and refrain from announcing major policy decisions or sanctioning expenditure for development schemes. If Modi wins a third term, he is likely to maintain his pro-Hindutva, anti-Muslim, and hegemonic attitude towards regional countries, particularly Pakistan.

The reforms go beyond just raising the retirement age or taxing pensions. Instead, a series of actions, similar to those that were done in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), should be seriously considered to reduce the cost of pensions to the government exchequer. The national pension cost will reach nearly Rs2 trillion in FY24, and it is predicted to rise to Rs10tr in the next decade if no reforms are implemented. In 2002-03, the pension cost stood at Rs25 billion, but in a span of just 20 years, it skyrocketed to over Rs1.5tr. Pension reforms have previously been tested in KP and generated the expected cost-saving results. It is high time to rationalise the existing pension programme and transition to more modern schemes available in developing and developed countries. Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb proposed to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years. It has sparked controversy over whether the government intends to benefit only a select few individuals. This decision has both advantages and disadvantages. In KP, the age restriction was raised to 63 years in 2019 with a projected annual savings of Rs20bn. However, the decision was reversed due to strong protest from bureaucrats, and the court also overturned the decision. However, KP’s other pension reforms remained in effect. KP Advisor on Finance Muzzammil Aslam has a different take on raising the age restriction than his predecessor, who implemented a series of reforms. Mr Aslam believes that the lump sum payment of pension payments will be delayed for the next five years, providing some breathing room for the time being. This will allow the government to show a lower budget deficit. The net impact will increase when the five-year allowances are added to the basic salary, which will be used to pay the pension. The age extension will postpone payments, but total payouts to employees will climb over the following five years. While these efforts provide some relief in the short term, crucial steps must be implemented to address the increasing pension liabilities. The government’s liabilities have jumped from Rs25bn in FY03 to Rs2tr in FY24 There is another idea to tax pensions. It may also face political challenges. However, the KP government has imposed a 5pc pension tax on grades 17 and above on their executive allowance. It is estimated that this measure alone will generate Rs150bn in contributions to a pay-as-you-go pension system. This was not an easy decision, but it was made in KP to obtain some contribution from existing employees. The federal government can look into this step in response to opposition to taxing pensions. KP reforms In 2004, based on recommendations from a World Bank project, the India implemented a national pension scheme wherein employee contributions are matched by the government. Pakistan did not choose to adopt it since it was not anticipated that the cost would rise so dramatically over the next 20 years. Taimur Khan Jhagra, former finance minister of KP, took the lead in implementing a series of pension reforms, including the introduction of a contributory pension scheme for new employees beginning July 1, 2022. Few substantial changes were made to the existing pension programme. A well-known 13-tier pension system was in place, covering the pensioner’s widow, children, parents, siblings, sisters, and grandchildren. KP confined it to direct dependents. The federal government did the same last year, but other provinces have not followed suit. The previous PTI government raised KP and Punjab’s minimum retirement age to 55 from 45, reducing KP’s pension bill by Rs20bn alone. KP consolidated various pensions into a single one. Previously, individuals could receive two pensions simultaneously, with an active employee receiving both a salary and a pension. The major reform is the implementation of a contributing pension scheme for new employees. Under this programme, the KP government contributes 12pc and employees contribute 10pc. So far, 40,000 staff have been hired under this system starting July 1, 2022. There are additional critical reforms that the KP and federal governments should implement, such as revisiting the single Universal Pay Scale between Grades 1 and 22. Pay in provinces is decoupled from the Centre and between departments, allowing each department to develop a pay scale appropriate for their budget and the market value of their professions. Pension reforms are greatly needed. The question is whether the state will be able to sustain pension payments for the next 10 to 15 years.

Children in the classrooms are busy making greeting cards, drawing pictures of themselves and the only woman whom they have come to know as their mother, their Chhoti (younger) Mummy Sabah Faisal Edhi. The duties of the busy mother of so many children, including four of her own, starts from early morning. After tending to her own household duties and sending off her youngest, Moosa Edhi, to school, she is in the nursery at 8am sharp, inquiring from the staff there if everyone had a good sleep, if anyone had any issues during the night. It has become a habit with her to visit the nursery first to inquire about her babies before getting to her other work of calling up the other Edhi Homes and Centres, asking about the other children, their health and school progress, asking about the women in their Homes, tending to the marriage proposals, and adoption procedures and planning outings and picnics for the children. When parents discover their babies are ‘not well’, they quietly leave them in our cot, says Sabah Edhi as country celebrates Mother’s Day today But today, before she can go inside the nursery, she stops in the playroom to admire three-year-old Fatima’s greeting her with a broad smile and a happy dance. Chhoti Mummy hugs the child and gestures to know if she has eaten breakfast. Fatima is deaf and mute. She has only recently been fitted with a cochlear implant, which has enabled her to hear and appreciate music to which she loves to dance. It is quite obvious that Sabah’s favourite in the nursery is five-year-old Moosa, named by Mummy, Bilquis Edhi, herself, after her own youngest grandson, Sabah and Faisal’s youngest son Moosa. But this Moosa, even though he is five, doesn’t look more than a year old. His growth is stunted. Sabah lifts him out of his cot and cuddles him lovingly. The nursery only has special children or children with learning disabilities. Moosa was the last child here named by Bilquis Edhi. The rest have been given names by their Chhoti Mummy. There are two newborn baby girls, Aimen and Noor Fatima, peacefully sleeping in their cradles in the cheerful blue nursery. Both the babies are blind. “The moment some parents discover that all is not well with their babies they quietly leave them in our cot,” says Sabah. “They never return for them,” she sighs. “Parents of very sick children, too, disown them even when they know that their child doesn’t have much time to live. We take them in, find them the best of medical care till the last of their breath,” she adds. “On discovering a child in the cot, we first try to get information about who left him or her there followed by a thorough medical check-up. If they are in need of medical care, we make sure that they receive the best that there is. Just the other day, someone left a little girl suffering from diarrhoea. She had to be hospitalised,” she informs. Just then one little girl, of about four years of age, who also looks like she is considerably attached to her Chhoti Mummy walks in and runs up to her. “She is normal. There is nothing wrong with this one,” Sabah says. “She says her name is Manahil. We found her near Sohrab Goth. Most of the children in our Sohrab Goth Centre are much older so I brought her here with me until we can find her parents,” she informs. “By the grace of God, there is no shortage of space, love and care in this Home built for these children by Edhi Sahab and Mummy,” she says, kissing the child’s head. “All children are a blessing, a priceless gift from God. I wish the parents who discard their children like or neglect them would realise this. I wish such parents could love their special, disabled or sick children like they love their normal children,” she says. “Sometimes, these very children who they love so much because they are normal and healthy grow up to discard their parents when they are old and weak. That’s the story of so many old people in our homes,” she concludes. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2024 Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.

The documentary shed light on various aspects of the life of Dr Aafia from her birth, education, marriage and to her kidnapping in Karachi and confinement in a notorious US prison. View this post on Instagram Aafia’s sister Dr Fowzia Siddiqui and Muslim Matters’ Editor-in-chief Hena Zuberi and others spoke at the event. Dr Fowzia said that her sister Dr Aafia was a gifted child, a bright scholar and a loving and caring person. She got a PhD degree in neurosciences from Brandies University of the US and it was her dream to revolutionise education system in Pakistan. In the documentary, human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, who currently represents Dr Aafia, said a vast majority of the American people had no idea who Dr Aafia was and they also did not care. He said that she has suffered a lot in the US prison and braved all sorts of torture. El-Hajj Mauri Saalakhan, the founding president and director of operations at The Aafia Foundation, told the documentary makers that after 9/11, the US targeted the human rights and liberties of people, especially Muslims. He said Dr Aafia also fell prey to this victimisation and in 2003 she was kidnapped, along with her children, in Karachi and got disappeared on mere suspicion that her husband had bought online night vision goggles. Umme Muhammad, the president of the Musawemem Campaign, said for the last 15 years she had been linked to the case of Dr Aafia but disappointingly nothing more could be achieved. She said Dr Aafia was targeted only because she was Muslim. Yvonne Ridley was amongst the first investigative journalists who told the world that Dr Aafia was jailed in Afghanistan. Talking about the grey lady prisoner of Bigram jail, she said in those times the US administration would dehumanise the prisoners and the same was done to Dr Aafia. She was wounded by the US soldiers and in injured condition she was brought to the US and tried by a court in a highly biased manner and jailed for long 86 years, which means the rest of her life. Zeina El-Debis, leader of the Friends of Aafia and founder of the Shade of Mercy Foundation, talked about their efforts to get Dr Aafia repatriated on humanitarian grounds. She said the documentary was also a part of such efforts. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2024 Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

The satellite, part of China’s Chang’e-6 lunar mission, was launched from the Hainan province on May 3 and had successfully entered the moon’s orbit at 1:14pm on May 8. The moon is at an average distance of 384,400km from earth. The lunar module was designed by Islamabad’s Institute of Space Technology (IST) in collaboration with China’s Shanghai University (SJTU) and Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco. The landmark images were unveiled at a ceremony organised at the China National Space Agency (CNSA) to mark the successful mission accomplishment, IST spokesperson and head of Department of Electrical and Computer Science, Dr Khurram Khursheed told Dawn.com. They were officially handed over to Pakistan’s ambassador to Beijing, she added. View this post on Instagram One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis\xadtan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the moon and the sun. —  Suparco/CNSA The iCube-Q orbiter carries two optical cameras to image the lunar surface. The module is a cube satellite or cubesat — miniature satellites typically characterised by their small size and standardized cubic design. Due to their compact size and relatively low cost compared to traditional satellites, CubeSats offered opportunities for universities, research institutions and commercial entities to participate in space missions and gather valuable data for scientific advancement and innovation. Operating in extreme temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius, the satellite features a 7-kilogramme one-megapixel camera tailored for missions with power constraints. Dr Khursheed had said the satellite would play a critical role in deep space missions. “Its surface-level analysis capabilities, transmitting images at a modest 1-kbps, will provide crucial data on crater locations, water, and traces of ice on the moon’s surface,” he had said. As the Chinese lander collects rock and soil samples, iCube-Q will spend three to six months orbiting the moon, capturing and transmitting images of the moon back to Earth. The IST said the opportunity to release the cubesat in lunar orbit from the Chang’e-6 mission was offered by the CNSA through the Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (Apsco). After a thorough evaluation, Pakistan’s proposal was accepted out of all Apsco member states. One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis\xadtan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the sun shining brightly. —  Suparco/CNSA The Chang’e-6 mission, which aims to explore the moon’s “dark side”, employs lunar research payloads from multiple countries, including Pakistan’s iCube-Qamar satellite. The mission is named after the mythical Chinese moon goddess. Nasa is banned by US law from any collaboration, direct or indirect, with China. On Chang’e-6, China is carrying payloads from France, Italy, Sweden and Pakistan, while Chang’e-7 will bear payloads from Russia, Switzerland and Thailand when it launches in 2026. Chang’e-6 aims to collect around 2kg of lunar samples from the far side of the Moon and bring them back to Earth for analysis. Chinese state news agency Xinhua had hailed it as “the first endeavour of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration”. China will send a robotic spacecraft in the coming days on a round trip to the moon’s far side in the first of three technically demanding missions that will pave the way for an inaugural Chinese crewed landing and a base on the lunar south pole. The probe is set to land in the immense South Pole-Aitken Basin, one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system. Once there, it will scoop up lunar soil and rocks, and carry out other experiments in the landing zone. With no direct line of sight with the Earth, Chang’e-6 must rely on a recently deployed relay satellite orbiting the moon during its 53-day mission, including a never-before-attempted ascent from the moon’s “hidden” side on its return journey home.

An IMF mission is expected to visit the country this month to discuss a new programme, ahead of the government beginning its annual budget-making process for the next financial year. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the fund in its staff report following the second and final review under the SBA. The fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements. Last month, the country completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stressed the need for a fresh, longer term programme. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust.

If jailed PTI leader and former prime minister Imran Khan’s article in UK’s conservative right-wing Telegraph newspaper blaming the military leadership directly for all his woes the week before was not hint enough of the state of play, two public statements by the latter clarified issues rather unambiguously. The first came in the DG ISPR’s press briefing, which was ostensibly called to discuss Afghanistan-based terrorist groups’ involvement in attacks on Chinese nationals working on development projects in the country. But in response to a couple of questions about the PTI and Imran Khan related to the events of May 9 last year, the DG ISPR stated unequivocally that the only path to rehabilitation for the political party and its leaders was to ‘seek forgiveness for attacking your own forces’. Then, perhaps, talks could happen and that too with ‘political parties’ (ie, the government), as the military had ‘nothing to do with politics’. Imran Khan has been consistent in saying he wouldn’t talk to the ‘powerless political parties’ and that a meaningful dialogue is possible only with the military. The DG ISPR also lamented the delay in the prosecution and sentencing of all those responsible for the May mayhem — including the ‘leaders and mastermind’ against whom ‘irrefutable evidence’ has been gathered and submitted — and, in doing so, appeared to hint at the establishment’s frustrations with what it perceives as roadblocks being erected by the judiciary. The content of the live presser evoked an equally adamant response from the PTI, which went on the offensive, reiterating its stance that May 9 was a ‘false flag operation’, accusing the military’s spokesman of being economical with the truth, and saying it would be happy to live with the findings of an impartial judicial commission into the May 9 events and would even apologise if found to be at fault. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. The military spokesman had pre-empted this demand in his briefing earlier by saying if a probe were to happen, as was being demanded, it ought to start with 2014, and not nine years later. The 2014 PTI sit-in in the federal capital was said to have been instigated and backed by the then ISI chief. This was the first indication that the military was prepared to hold its own accountable for past follies, if it paved the way for the trials and sentencing of PTI leaders it says were responsible for the attacks on defence installations in a number of cities in Punjab and KP. While the spokesman left nothing to the imagination, on the first anniversary of May 9, the army chief added his voice to his chief spokesman’s in terms of stressing the need for punishing the perpetrators of the violence a year earlier, also lashing out against what he called ‘digital terrorism’. This indicates that harsher curbs on social media are planned. So far, the PTI has had overwhelming social media dominance and had been able to keep a step ahead of its adversaries, but we will find out soon whether it has what it takes to bypass software the Chinese have developed over the years (and Pakistan has reportedly acquired) and successfully used to block dissident content. With this ever-widening gulf between the establishment and the party it once saw as a panacea for all that ails Pakistan, the one thing that many felt could force a rethink in the establishment would have been a public manifestation of the immense support enjoyed by the PTI, as evidenced in last February’s elections. Many Pakistan watchers keenly waited all day for multitudes of PTI supporters to spill out onto the roads and streets of major urban conurbations on the party leader’s call to ‘break the shackles’ and protest on May 9. But the brutal crackdown of the past one year seems to have knocked the wind out of the party’s sails and worn down the workers’ will. People may turn out to vote for it in droves, but did not appear prepared to risk life, limb and liberty in coming out for mass protests. Some small localised protests did happen, but had zero impact in the sense of influencing decision-making in the corridors of power. Going forward, a couple of factors will play a role in steering developments. The first and foremost will be the confidence the army chief has in his control over his institution. His predecessor appointed a dozen major generals to three stars in his final six weeks in office and left the incumbent little room in terms of forming his own team. Natural attrition and the more dramatic exit of a couple of three stars on disciplinary grounds recently has, 18 months down the line, given the chief an opportunity to place senior officers of his own choosing in key roles which will give him greater freedom of action both inside and outside the institution. The promotion of three officers this week, including the DG ISPR, to three stars was another step in that direction. The military saw May 9 as a coup against the chief, a failed attempt to dislodge him from office. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. With the PTI protests failing to gather momentum, the only impediment in his path seems to be an increasingly assertive superior judiciary. It can and will, in all likelihood, challenge the establishment’s pre-eminence in decision-making. It isn’t clear how the latter plans to deal with that, especially because it believes that a direly needed economic revival is only possible under the umbrella of a hybrid set-up and in a relatively calm political environment. Only the judiciary can rock its boat now.

Copyright © 2024, Dawn NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Insurgency and social change - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'THE recent killing of seven barbershop workers from Punjab in Gwadar is another indicator that the insurgency in Balochistan is evolving and intensifying demographic changes, which will impact the sociopolitical landscape of the province. Although targeted killings of settlers in Balochistan are not a new trend, the emergence of the Balochistan Liberation Army as the primary insurgent group has significantly increased operational capacities and diversified targets. While the BLA has not officially claimed responsibility for the Gwadar attack, it is likely the act of one of its wings or affiliate groups. Last month, the group carried out a significant attack, killing nine people from central Punjab who were planning on reaching Europe through Iran. Based on their ethnicity, BLA gunmen abducted them from a bus bound for Taftan and later dumped their bodies under a bridge in a hilly area of Noshki. In a similar attack, possibly by the same gunmen, two people were killed when they tried to escape the assailants’ cordon on N-40, the Quetta-Noshki highway. Following the Noshki attack, the BLA issued a statement claiming that its special squad had killed ‘agents’ of Pakistan’s intelligence agencies who, they claimed, were travelling in plain clothes on the bus. However, media reports and investigations later revealed that the victims were using the Balochistan route to travel to Iran and onward to Europe. Baloch militants view workers and travellers from Punjab as collaborators or agents of security forces or the federal government. Attacks targeting Punjabi workers and settlers have occurred in various parts of the province in the past. It appears that the insurgents kill settlers because they are non-combatants and, as such, easy targets. Militant groups assign such tasks to their new recruits to test their conviction and draw them into the cycle of violence. While one can comprehend Baloch grievances against the state institutions and Punjab, it is also crucial to understand why they target non-combatants who have been serving them for years. Whenever anger flares against the state’s flawed policies, settlers become the targets. Traditionally, Baloch society has a few key professions. Hairdressing is one of the major ones they miss. Teaching comes next, with teachers from Punjab and the Urdu-speaking community making significant contributions to the education sector in the province. Like tribal codes in other parts of the country, the Baloch follow the tradition of hosting members of different ethnicities without integrating them into their tribal ethics. This is a common practice, as assimilation is a long process. The same applies to settlers from Punjab and urban Sindh, who have embraced the norms of Baloch society, while maintaining ties with their native towns and communities. However, Punjabis constitute the largest ethnic group in the country and wield significant power and resources, leading to resentment not only among the Baloch, but also Pakhtuns and Sindhis. Whenever anger flares against the establishment and the state’s flawed policies, settlers become the targets of this animosity. Historically, barbers have been the first victims when such hatred triggers violence. It is worth noting that many of these barbers hail from southern Punjab, much of which identifies itself as Baloch, but their official domicile determines their identity and ethnicity. Over the last two decades, Pakhtuns have captured market businesses in urban Balochistan, while Sindhis have gradually become prominent in the labour market. Despite issues of ethnic and tribal pride and sociocultural differences, there has been no hostility towards these communities. This is because both ethnicities are part of Balochistan and share some cultural commonalities. Moreover, both communities have faced major hostility, apart from minor issues related to ethnic and tribal pride and sociocultural differences. The reasons are that both ethnicities are part of Balochistan and share few other cultural commonalities, but both are also seen as deprived communities and, in the past, have remained part of the political struggle for rights. Insurgencies have no room for neutrality or ambiguity, as insurgents seek clear distinctions between friends and foes. In places like Myanmar and India, ethnic insurgents target civilians from minority ethnic groups, as well as engage in property destruction and other abuses. While small ethnic groups may strive to maintain a neutral stance, they often find themselves between insurgents and counterinsurgents in grey areas. This dynamic is evident among Pakhtuns and Sindhis, who have been targeted by insurgents while working on government projects. The contractors had hired them as an alternative to Punjabi labour, but they were not spared despite a sense of affinity with them. Sociopolitical transformation is a complex phenomenon, which is influenced not only by insurgents but also by internal societal changes. Baloch society is transforming due to rural-to-urban migration, increasing literacy rates, and improved connectivity. Similar to Karachi’s experience, urbanisation in Quetta is making other major urban centres multi-ethnic too. Despite ethnic bonds with Sindhis, coexistence with Pakhtuns and Sindhis may face occasional challenges. Additionally, religion presents a growing challenge, as religious fervour increases alongside literacy rates among the Baloch. While this may appear advantageous for state institutions seeking cohesion through religion, religiosity has not weakened Balochistan’s nationalistic sentiments. The promotion of religious organisations and madressahs by state institutions has failed to make a significant impact, mainly due to the vast disparities within Baloch society’s tribal, rural, and urban composition, which foster diverse political interests. The very forces undermining peace are now major power players. At the national level, the province’s poor human development and governance indicators leave ample space for resistance politics. Sociopolitical changes often trigger paradoxical sentiments, with simultaneous pro-development and anti-development attitudes emerging. When the sense of deprivation intensifies, and resource distribution becomes contentious, it creates a conducive environment for militants to recruit, expand, and diversify their targets and tactics. Targeting non-combatants of the majority group reflects a deepening societal anger at this level. This is the most crucial level, as the state has to rethink and correct its approach towards Balochistan. The writer is a security analyst.

You know the ones with the straw protruding from its top? The most coveted one at the moment is the one which retails for around $45 — which is roughly Rs12,000, but sells for Rs18,000 in some Karachi markets. This water bottle is a reminder of how our overconsumption is exacerbating the climate crisis. Despite all the evidence, it doesn’t feel like a climate crisis when you look at our tendency to buy more — of everything. Plenty has been written about how bulk buying of clothes has accelerated fast fashion culture. These fast-moving trends have a devastating impact on the climate, from labour abuse in the garment industry to microfibres polluting Earth and water. The fashion industry is estimated to be responsible for 10 per cent of global carbon emissions, according to a 2020 report by the European Parliament. Although fashion houses will use terms like ‘sustainable practices’, only 1pc of used clothing is recycled into new clothes. The global textile production has doubled from 58 million tonnes in 2010 and is expected to grow to 145m tonnes by 2030, says the European Environment Agency. This is great news for world economies, except that it takes 200 years for some materials to decompose: synthetic fabrics like polyester, for example, break down into small plastic particles which last forever. This should horrify us, but one look at women lining up to buy the new XYZ designer lawn collection across Pakistan proves we’ve not grasped the severity of the climate crisis. Or care about it. I can sympathise with this, having heard people say how despondent they feel about the state of the … well, state; how change doesn’t seem likely, so why care about the environment. My students, however, care very much about the environment, more than politicians do; they are inheriting a planet deluged in waste. But as valiant a generation this Z is proving — defying university’s bullying tactics for example — they are, according to studies, also the most likely to be influenced. Earlier, there was value attached to things and a sensibility too. Against this backdrop, what’s the harm in buying a stainless steel cup which comes with a lifetime guarantee? Because it does not stop at one cup. You only have to go to TikTok to see the cupboards lined up with up to 37 different coloured cups of a single brand. People line up outside stores to buy the new release, there are sites dedicated to selling them. This particular company, which catered to blue collar workers in the US, has gone from earning $73m in 2019 to $750m last year, according to Vox. The company’s claim, that it can keep cold drinks cold for 11 hours and hot drinks hot for seven hours, received an unlikely boost when, last year, a woman’s cup survived a car fire. The woman posted a Tik Tok (of course) of her burned-to-a-shell car, but the cup remained in its cup holder, and she rattled it to show the ice was still in it. This was marketing gold for the company, which bought the lady a new car and cup. It is this kind of marketing which adds to a product’s status and makes it more desirable. And causes a lot of problems for the environment. According to a story in the New York Times, producing one stainless steel water bottle was “far more environmentally damaging” than producing a plastic bottle. I recognise I’m being more judgemental than usual, and while I am loathe to shame people for their choices, I’m bothered by what these cups are selling — health as a status symbol. As Vox pointed out, people leave comments saying they are hydrated bec\xadause of such cups. This idea extends to other wellness products: “if you buy these clothes or these classes, you will unlock a better, healthier version of yourself,” writes Vox. Health and hydration, like skin care, supplements, yoga pants etc, are part of a self-care trend that only fuels fast capitalism. Our elders were not immune to material acquisition, but there was value attached to things and a sensibility too. Clothes were upcycled, passed onto younger children, handed down as heirlooms even. Today, it is easy to buy goods from the comfort of your phone, but it is not quenching our desire to want more. This desire is not helping our well-being, because retail therapy, as Time wrote last month, “is tanking your mental health”. How do we return to a time of stretching the shelf life of things, reusing, recycling, taming the beast in us that wants more irrespective of whether we need it? Simply by buying less, we will see a reduction in emissions and pollution. This is the goal we need to practise and teach our children as their future is at stake.

But Japan levelled matters and then Pakistan could not hold their nerve in the penalty shootout, losing 4-1 after the match had ended 2-2 in regulation time. Head coach Roeltant Oltmans had said on the eve of the match that it would be a good experience for his youthful side if the final went to a shootout. The hope is that these young men, who have rekindled hopes of hockey’s revival in Pakistan, will learn from this and return stronger. Pakistan had reached the final of the Azlan Shah Cup for the first time in 13 years after being unbeaten in the round-robin stage. On their way, Pakistan held New Zealand to a draw. Overall, the team’s performance can be a starting point to build upon. Ahead of the final, Oltmans had spoken about the potential of this current lot, whilst also slamming critics in a pointed message to the country’s former Olympians, who have been resentful of a foreign coach being at the helm of the national team. The Dutchman has shown he deserves a longer, more consistent run, instead of being called up tournament after tournament. For that, matters pertaining to the running of the Pakistan Hockey Federation must be settled. The PHF had split into two factions ahead of the Azlan Shah Cup. The government’s intervention resolved the dispute at least until the end of the tournament but a final decision is yet to be reached. Pakistan have failed to qualify for the last three Olympics and that woeful run will continue if matters are not resolved. Oltmans and his charges have provided hope, and with the better running of PHF, there is an opportunity for Pakistan to return to its former standing in world hockey. It should not be missed.

Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

The Paris St Germain forward confirmed Friday he is leaving the Ligue 1 side after seven years and although he did not spell out his future, the world expects only one destination. Real have chased Mbappe for years without success but are finally poised to secure the 25-year-old at the end of his PSG deal. The French national team captain’s name was on everyone’s lips — those hawking Real merchandise on match days have been selling Mbappe scarves for weeks. Los Blancos became Spanish champions for the 36th time last week with four games to spare in La Liga and reached the Champions League final this week by overcoming Bayern Munich. Signing Mbappe, as the Spanish media report is now an inevitability, only seems a matter of time and could cap a glorious few weeks for Madrid president Florentino Perez. “Au revoir” ran the headline in Spanish sports daily AS, who report Mbappe’s signing will be announced in the next few weeks  “barring any major surprises”. Real are not expected to make any announcement until the end of the season, after the Champions League final against Dortmund at Wembley on June 1. Mbappe has never won the Champions League, which has been PSG’s main ambition during his time at the club. Real Madrid, meanwhile, have lifted the trophy five times in the last decade. On Friday, Mbappe said on X that his final home game for PSG will be on Sunday against Toulouse. “I never thought it would be this difficult to leave my country,” he said in the video post. “I think I needed this, a new challenge after seven years.” ‘CLUB LEGEND’ On the eve of his final home game for PSG, Mbappe was hailed as a “club legend” on Saturday by the coach Luis Enrique. “All I can say is marvellous things about Kylian Mbappe as a footballer and person,” Enrique told a press conference of the 25-year-old who has scored a club record 255 goals including 43 this season. “I understand his decision. He has been here for seven years and as a club legend. He has given everything to this club, and this club has given him everything as well. I wish him all the best for the future.” Spanish media report Mbappe’s grand unveiling at the Bernabeu is scheduled for the first week of June, after the Champions League final and before Les Bleus set off for Euro 2024, starting in Germany on June 14. MACRON’S OLYMPIC HOPE The Olympics in Paris open soon after the European Championships and French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday he hoped Mbappe would play in this year’s Games. “I have no particular comment to make other than the fact that I am counting upon Real Madrid to free up Kylian for the Olympic Games so he can play with the French team,” Macron said in a video posted on his X account. Real have already said that it will not lift its players’ obligations to the club in favour of their participation in the Olympics Games which are not part of the FIFA-designated international tournaments for which clubs must free up their players.

The Japanese side drew first blood against Pakistan as they opened the scoring in the first half after the latter’s weak defence let in the Japanese forward from the left wing. Pakistan drew level in and then took the lead against Japan in the second half, turning the tie around with two goals in quick succession. The Japanese side then equalised late to send the game to a penalty shootout. Japan won the tie as they converted all four penalties in the shootout while Pakistan only managed one out of three. The Pakistan hockey team played in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup 2024 final after a gap of 13 years. The finalists had already been decided before the last round of matches was played and Japan’s 3-1 win over Canada saw them finish two points above Paki\xadstan in the table. The final of the Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament was played in Ipoh, Malaysia. Pakistan continued their then-unbeaten run at the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup with a creditable 1-1 draw against New Zealand in their last round-robin mat\xadch yesterday. Pakistan and Japan had played out a 1-1 draw in their round-robin encounter and Pakistan’s coach Roelant Oltmans expected another tight match in the final. “Japan have neither scored many goals nor conceded many. They are a good side,” Oltmans told reporters after the ma\xadtch against New Zealand. “We need to open them up. We have the players to do it, but it will not be easy. They are compact and organised defensively.” Pakistan fell behind to Paris Olympics-bound New Zealand when Luke Hol\xadmes scored in the 35th minute but kept their unbeaten run intact thanks to Abu Bakr Mahmood’s penalty corner conversion eight minutes later. “The first half was New Zealand’s and the second half was ours,” Oltmans told reporters. “Our start was not good and we conceded two penalty comers in the first minute. “But this cannot happen in the final against Japan. The players did very well in this tournament but I am not satisfied with our performances in the first half. We were terrible in ball possession. We lost it even before can could even dominate the game. It is not the way we should play. The boys came out really good and we created penalty corner opportunities. We managed to score even with one player less,” he said. The government and the nation expressed their best wishes for the team in the final and had hoped for a victorious outcome. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appreciated the “outstanding performance” of the national team, adding that winning or losing was part of the game. “The national team has won the hearts of the entire nation,” the PM Media Office said in a press release quoting the prime minister. He reiterated that the government was taking all steps to promote sports in the country, particularly hockey. He earlier congratulated the side for making it to the tournament final after 13 years. Shehbaz said that renewed interest in hockey throughout Pakistan signalled a promising trend for the future. President Asif Ali Zardari also appreciated the “excellent performance” and said that the development and promotion of hockey needed attention. “It is hoped that the Pakistani hockey team will perform better in the future,” the president said. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz earlier expressed her best wishes for the Pakistan side. “Pakistan will emerge victorious in the final against Japan. The team’s performance captured the nation’s attention, and hopes are high for a triumphant outcome.” Maryam said. “Pakistanis are fervently praying for victory,” she added. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Ahmed Bugti had commended the team for their previously undefeated record. “Insha’Allah, Pakistan will win the final match; the Pakistani hockey team deserves recognition for making it to the championship game after 13 years,” he said. The government made special arrangements to broadcast the match live for the public. Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

A powerful solar storm — which could continue into Sunday — has triggered spectacular celestial shows usually confined to the far northern reaches of the planet, hence their nickname of the “northern lights”. “I have the sensation of living through a historic night in France […] It was really charged, with solar particles and emotions,” Eric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Observatoire de Cote d’Azur, wrote on social media after the first night. “Find good spots, away from the lights, with a clear view to the north!” Late on Saturday evening, pictures again started trickling onto social media as people in the United States reported sightings, though not as strong as Friday night’s. The first of several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun —  came just after 4pm GMT on Friday, according to the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). It was later upgraded to an “extreme” geomagnetic storm —  the first since the “Halloween Storms” of October 2003 that caused blackouts in Sweden and damaged power infrastructure in South Africa. Friday’s storm was listed as hitting level five geomagnetic conditions — the highest on the scale. Saturday saw G3 to G5 conditions, with G4 or higher conditions predicted Sunday and G3 conditions possible into Monday. But no major disruptions to power or communications networks appear to have been reported this time around, despite initial worries from authorities. There have only been “preliminary reports of power grid irregularities, degradation to high-frequency communications, GPS and possibly satellite navigation,” the SWPC said. Elon Musk, whose Starlink satellite internet operator has some 5,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, said his satellites were “under a lot of pressure, but holding up so far”. However China’s National Centre for Space Weather issued a “red alert” on Saturday morning, warning the storm will impact communications and navigation in most areas of the country, state news agency Xinhua reported. Auroras were visible in the northern half of the country, according to media reports. Excitement over the phenomenon —  and otherworldly photos of pink, green and purple night skies —  popped up across the world, from Mont Saint-Michel on the French coast to Payette, Idaho — in the western United States — to Australia’s island state of Tasmania. People pose for photos as a geomagnetic storm lights up the night sky above the Bonneville Salt Flats on May 10 in Wendover, Utah. — AFP Unlike solar flares, which travel at the speed of light and reach Earth in around eight minutes, CMEs travel at a more sedate pace, with officials putting the current average at 800 kilometres per second. The CMEs emanated from a massive sunspot cluster that is 17 times wider than our planet. People with eclipse glasses can also look for the sunspot cluster during the day. The Sun is approaching the peak of an 11-year cycle that brings heightened activity. NOAA’s Brent Gordon encouraged the public to try to capture the night sky with phone cameras even if they couldn’t see auroras with their naked eyes. “You’d be amazed at what you see in that picture versus what you see with your eyes.” Fluctuating magnetic fields associated with geomagnetic storms induce currents in long wires, including power lines, which can potentially lead to blackouts. Long pipelines can also become electrified, leading to engineering problems. Spacecraft are also at risk from high doses of radiation, although the atmosphere prevents this from reaching Earth. NASA has a dedicated team looking into astronaut safety and can ask astronauts on the International Space Station to move to places within the outpost that are better shielded. Even pigeons and other species that have internal biological compasses could be affected. Pigeon handlers have noted a reduction in birds coming home during geomagnetic storms, according to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The most powerful geomagnetic storm in recorded history, known as the Carrington Event after British astronomer Richard Carrington, occurred in September 1859.

Before you grab your wallet and rush to your nearest mall to grab a basic candle and a basic kurta from K̶h̶a̶a̶d̶i̶ a local clothing store, know that we asked a bunch of moms what they really, truly want for Mother’s Day and we have the perfect answers for you. But, you won’t get them straight away. First, let us give you a little history lesson on why Mother’s Day is celebrated (just read it, your mom will be proud of you for knowing something). In the United States, Mother’s Day falls on the second Sunday of May, every year — and this year it is on May 12. Other countries have varying traditions and dates for marking the occasion, but since the US version currently looms over us, and most likely when your mom is expecting her present, we’ll stick to that one. The idea started in America when a woman, Anna Jarvis, held a small memorial service for her own mother on May 12, 1907, the BBC details. Shortly after that, most places in the US started celebrating the day, with the US president — he must’ve really loved his mother — making it a national holiday in 1914. Jarvis, however, was super unhappy with how companies began using the day as a money-making scheme and campaigned for the government to remove Mother’s Day from the calendar completely. Keeping in line with the theme of not getting what you wanted, Jarvis’s campaign against the holiday presumably did not work very well, because more than a century later we’re celebrating the holiday on a completely different continent —\xa0personally, I find it funny that we’re adhering to the US iteration of the holiday, even though the UK has their own version and they were the ones who colonised us and left us with a plethora of their traditions. We’re sorry we continue the tradition, Jarvis, we just love our moms! Given the global popularity of the day, mothers must definitely be an integral pillar of the family, right? Well, that and the fact that they risk their own lives to bring you into this world and then spend every subsequent moment putting your needs before their own. So the question remains — what do we get our moms for Mother’s Day? What could be possibly good enough for the women who care for us from the get-go and don’t stop until their very last breath? Here at Images, we thought the solution was simple — ask the moms what they want! Revolutionary. Here’s what moms want for Mother’s Day. I couldn’t start my research anywhere but my own mother, who has two kids — my younger brother (19) and me (24). Her answer was pretty straightforward, she wanted candles. This was not the reply I was hoping to hear, so I pushed her for another answer; after all, I had an article to write. Her second answer was that she wanted us to spend time with her, which pretty much ruined any plans I had of going out that night. Don’t worry, I will spend a lot of time with her! While some moms want their children to spend more time with them, other mothers, especially those with younger kids, want some space — and rightfully so, I mean have you ever spent every single day with a five-year-old? They talk. A LOT. A mother of a four-year-old and an 11-month-old said she would love to check into a hotel with a stunning view, and spend a day being herself “without any roles like mother, wife, and sister”. “I’d get up whenever I want, eat anything I want, and just relax. I’d like my best friend to be there with me, and chat about everything but kids and husband and home,” she said. Mothers deserve the rest and relaxation — fresh white linens, room service, and absolutely no screams, snots or scrapes. Another mom, with children aged 11, 15 and 16, said she wanted a nice staycation away with the kids, but swiftly added that she would be okay without her children, too. And, again, we get it, we totally do, anyone would want some time away from the constant barrage of “mom, mom, mom, mom, mom?!”. A mom of a 12 and 16-year-old said she wanted breakfast in bed, a handmade card, a day without household chores and an official holiday from work — all of this seems achievable, except the last one. Capitalism will never give in that easily, unfortunately. However, maybe a sick leave would work? Even better, blame it on your kid and say they’re sick — hey, there have to be some perks to having children, and what are children even for if not to use for fake illness so you can enjoy Mother’s Day? “Somewhere I could just relax and not worry about the kids — like a girls’ trip but with [the] kids who would be looked after by the nannies,” a mother of a three-year-old and a 10-year-old said. You know, being a mother is starting to sound a lot like being a 24/7 nanny. We really hope this mother gets some help with her kids, even if just for the day. When we asked a mother of a six and 11-year-old, her answer was short and sweet: “A day off from all responsibilities”. Given everything mothers do, for not just their kids but their entire family, wanting to do nothing is totally valid. So, perhaps the perfect gift for your mother would be you picking up the slack and doing some work around the house to offer her respite. A mom of an eight-month-old said she wanted a nanny who would supervise her baby, feed her and put her to bed, “basically all the tasks that [a] mother does”. She added that most importantly, she wanted a nanny to look after her baby so she could tend to other household chores — which has us shook; you would think the ONE time mothers are asked about themselves, they would prioritise themselves, instead of thinking about chores?! Leave it to moms and mom-figures to only think about working to make their family’s lives better. It is (going to be) Mother’s Day and we strongly believe moms should not do any household tasks on such a sacred day. Another thing mothers really want? Your love — and that costs literally nothing. A mom of an eight-year-old said she wanted a handwritten note declaring how much her child loved her and why. Not only does that sound super sweet, it’s perfect for the age demographic. I’m sure moms can be the only people who cherish young children’s art; it’s called “unconditional love” for a reason. A mother of two teenage girls, on the other hand, said she “craves the feeling of being essential and cherished once more”. “While I cherish their independence, I long for reassurance from them.” She added that material gifts did hold some significance, and she preferred small, meaningful presents sprinkled throughout the day rather than one grand gesture. I’m going to take a moment here to say it sounds scary to be the mother of not one, but TWO teenagers. It’s like having the pretty, popular kids from school live with you. “You want to hang?” “No.” “You want to get some lunch?” “No.” “We could go out?” “No.” “Plus I want their father to know that he got the best mother for his kids he could possibly ask,” she added. My aunt, who has a 30-year-old daughter, maintained that material things were not for her at all. “I would want nothing more than the happiness of my child, and seeing them happy and relaxed is my goal. But the one thing I do want is for them to eat the food I have cooked and enjoy it. Nothing is more comforting and fulfilling for a mother than some time spent with her children”. Food is a reccurring theme, maybe because a lot of our mothers spend so much of their time and effort slaving away over the stove. A mother of three aged 18, 23 and 26 said she wanted all three of her kids to cook something for her separately, before quickly adding that she did not want that from her 18-year-old because she has exams. Once again, leave it to moms to worry about their children, even when they’re asked what they want. A quick pasta recipe won’t take more than 30 minutes, which is the perfect break from studying — don’t forget your mom did EVERYTHING with you inside her for nine months, and then clung to her hip for years. Time to repay her for you basically being a little parasite. However, the best answer came from a mother of a 15 and an 18-year-old: “As a mother, I want kids who are like dogs — they don’t answer back, wag their tails to greet you and are happy no matter what the treat is. Not this teenage attitude, shattitude.” LOL! A mother of a four-year-old and a newborn baby said people should, at the very least, acknowledge everything mothers do and all the sacrifices they make, even if they do not support the mom because for mothers “everything is happening all at once”. She also joked that she would like some peace as well to enjoy a cup of tea or a meal, and as she was speaking her child could be heard in the background. “This! We want to be able to do one thing without interruptions.” Being a mother cannot be easy, and one of the biggest stresses they face is the situation of the country they are raising their children in. A Dawn staffer, who is the mother of a two-year-old, told me that mothers, by virtue of motherhood, do not think of their own selves and always have their child on their mind. She said that she wanted the very best for her daughter and nothing for herself. “I constantly think of the future of the country she lives in and what I can do to give my child the very best chance at life in Pakistan. What I would want is to see my child grow and thrive, and for my efforts to be paid off.” Another young mom, with an 18-month-old daughter, said she wished a fairy godmother would come to Pakistan and make it a safer place for children, and that her child’s safety and security were the only things that worried her after she became a mother. Australian social worker Shaniera Akram, who is based in Karachi, had a special message for Mother’s Day: “To all the mothers out there, whether they are mothers who have given birth, adopted or become stepmothers, our job is all-consuming. There is no off button. We are on the job 24/7 and it is hard but what we get out of it is more rewarding than any you can ever ask for. We get to say at the end of the day, ‘we did that, we raised them and they are amazing’. That’s the biggest gift you can get as a mother.” So ditch the motia scented candle — I won’t be though, my mother is definitely getting the candle she wants — and the basic kurta. Chances are, your mom, no matter how old you are, wants some peace, some love and maybe some pampering. Now that we have equipped you with all this information, go forth and make this the perfect Mother’s Day. We would recommend some breakfast in bed (for your mom, not by her), some quality time with her and then some rest and relaxation for her while you look after everyday chores. Happy Mother’s Day to all mother-figures (and best of luck with your kids)! Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

Entitled. Snowflakes. Lazy. These are some of the characterisations about Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) pushed in the media by older generations who have largely failed to connect with and understand what they are all about. But these disparaging words used to describe the generation are, in fact, baseless — these young individuals are anything but passive. To put it simply, this generation isn’t waiting for change; they’re demanding it. Over the past six months alone, they’ve orchestrated movements that have sent shockwaves through the status quo, leaving elites squirming in discomfort. It’s time to recognise their power, their passion, and their potential to reshape our world that has been long ruined by decades of complacency. Pro-Palestinian students take part in a protest in support of the Palestinians amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, at Columbia University in New York City, US, October 12, 2023 — Reuters We are seeing this play out at university campuses across America, where administrators resort to police intervention to suppress anti-war protests and encampments, only to witness a resounding backlash that reverberates far beyond their expectations. Tensions began to simmer on American university campuses soon after the terror attacks carried out by Hamas on October 7. As Israel continues to unleash an orgy of violence on Palestinians — the International Court of Justice has found it “plausible” that Israel is in violation of the Genocide Convention — the atmosphere on campuses has grown increasingly charged. Student groups have been suspended, walkouts have become increasingly common, and university towns have become the epicentre of the uncommitted campaign during the Democratic primary elections. A coalition of University of Michigan students rally at an encampment in the Diag to pressure the university to divest its endowment from companies that support Israel or could profit from the ongoing conflict on the University of Michigan college campus in Ann Arbor — Reuters Contrary to what the mainstream media would have you believe, the seething discontent isn’t confined to elite or progressive universities like Columbia and Berkeley. The numbers speak for themselves: one-third of adults under 30 say that their “sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people (compared to 10 per cent or less for adults over 50), while 36pc of them believe that President Biden is “favouring Israelis too much” (compared to the 16pc or less for adults over 50). This has become a headache for Joe Biden, as he relies on the support of younger Americans to secure victory in the upcoming election in November. Demonstrators protest inside the Rockefeller Center asking for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as President Joe Biden attends an interview in midtown Manhattan, in New York, February 26 — Reuters The ongoing conflict is yet another testament to Generation Z’s profound empathy and commitment to equity, inclusion, and human rights. According to an Edelman survey spanning six countries, a staggering 70pc of Gen Z actively engages in social or political causes. What sets this generation apart is their digital fluency, enabling them to harness digital platforms, including decentralised media, to mobilise, educate, and advocate for change. Moreover, data shows that this generation watches the least amount of television, and prefers consuming content on platforms like TikTok (10.5 hours a week) and YouTube (6.9 hours a week). In fact, the fast-tracked nature of legislation seeking a TikTok ban in America is very much related to the fallout of the war in Gaza, and has unsurprisingly angered young Americans. Students build a protest encampment in support of Palestinians, at the University of Southern California’s Alumni Park, amid the ongoing conflict, in Los Angeles, California, US, April 24, 2024 — Reuters Engage in conversation with older generations, and you’ll often hear the refrain: “Younger generations are out of touch, indifferent, and perpetually glued to their screens.” Yet, this worry overlooks a crucial truth. As digital natives, today’s youth possess an unparalleled ability to navigate the labyrinth of misinformation, actively seek out diverse perspectives, and circumvent traditional gatekeepers, particularly within the media landscape. Their digital prowess not only connects them to the pulse of reality but empowers them to shape it with unprecedented clarity and purpose. Most importantly, Gen Z is demonstrating an unwavering commitment to a host of global challenges, spanning from climate change and gender diversity to the plight of Palestine. It speaks of their values and sense of responsibility — something their parents and mentors should not only acknowledge but also take immense pride in. Greek university and high school students take part in a demonstration against a planned bill which opens the way for the operation of private universities, in Athens, Greece, January 11, 2024 — Reuters Demonstrators and students hit a wall as they shout slogans during a protest against the Chilean public education system and the results of the referendum on a new constitution, in Santiago, Chile September 6, 2022 — Reuters From Malala Yousafzai to Greta Thunberg — the emerging cohort of leaders, particularly women — is mobilising millions worldwide. For adults, especially those clinging onto institutions and power, this rising generation represents a threat. This is not only because of the fact that these leaders and organisers are speaking truth to power, but because they are seeking to dismantle the status quo in a bid to build something better and more inclusive. Moreover, the discomfort among established elites stems from their utter cluelessness in navigating the digital landscape wielded by younger generations. This new breed of leaders is not only adept at harnessing digital tools but also possesses a deep understanding of how to use them effectively, leaving the status quo scrambling to keep pace. Demonstrators take part in an “Emergency Rally: Stand with Palestinians Under Siege in Gaza,” amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, October 14, 2023 — Reuters The unfolding events across American universities serve as a stark reminder: nothing rattles status quo elites more than the sight of peaceful protestors courageously raising their voices. This has been consistently true across centuries. Yet, amid the turbulence, organisation and activism displayed by these students is inspiring next generation of leaders around the world. It’s safe to say that the kids are doing just fine. It is the adults running the world that are the problem.

The study is set to redefine such carriers as having a ‘new genetic form’ of the mind-wasting disease. The reclassification may change the current norms surrounding Alzheimer’s research, diagnosis and approaches to treatment, according to the researchers. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine. “Through the data, we are saying that perhaps this is a genetic form of this disease, not merely a risk factor indication” the co-author of the study, Sterling Johnson, from the University of Wisconsin’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center told reporters at a press briefing. Scientists have known for three decades that individuals with two copies of APOE4 gene variant, have a significantly higher risk of developing the disease, as compared to individuals with the most common version of the APOE gene, known as APOE3. About 2 to 3 per cent of the general population, or about 15 per cent of people with Alzheimer’s, have two copies of the APOE4 variant. “This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer’s if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer’s earlier than people without this gene,” stated professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Edinburgh (Tara was not involved in the study). Dr. Juan Fortea and his colleagues, from the University of Barcelona conducted an in-depth study of more than 3,000 brains donated from the US National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Centre. They also delved into biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from five datasets in three countries. They found that by the age of 65, at least 95pc of people with two copies of APOE4, known as ‘homozygotes’, had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer’s-related protein termed ‘beta amyloid’ in their spinal fluid, while 75pc had positive brain scans for amyloid. Nearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at the age of 65 than people who were not carrying the risk variant. The findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three fundamental criteria for being a genetic disease. Firstly, almost all individuals with these two gene variants have Alzheimer’s biology, they all develop symptoms at about the same rate and clinical and biological changes occur in a sequence that may be predicted, the researchers stated. A Professor of the UCL Genetics Institute, namely David Curtis (who was not involved in the research), remained unconvinced of the findings. “I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some ‘distinct genetic form’ of Alzheimer’s disease’,” he said in a statement. “No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer’s disease” he said. The findings could have broader implications for the recently approved Alzheimer’s treatment ‘Leqembi’ by Eisai and Biogen. This a drug that reportedly removes amyloid from the brain. In clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant depicted much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. In view of this, some centres shy away from treating these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, who worked on the study, stated at the press briefing.

Startled you with my letter, right? And you are wondering what on earth has made me write a letter when I could have simply messaged you or called you up. And I know, fumbling with anxiety, you have checked your phone by now to see if you had missed my calls or messages. So let me assure you, everything is fine Maa, please do not fret. And keep reading this. You know, this time I wanted to do something really special for you on Mother’s Day. First, I thought of gifting you those emerald earrings you longed to have, the ones whose picture you have saved in your phone’s gallery for ages. Or buy you a pair of comfy shoes that will help you walk around, doing the household chores easily. But then I realised that these materialistic things will not reveal my love for you until I express it myself. Let me put it straight — for me, Mother’s Day is not meant to be celebrated on only one day of the year, every day is Mother’s Day.  How? Because I cannot imagine a day without your presence. The very thought of life without you makes my heart skip a beat. My day kick-starts when each morning you wake me up for the Fajr prayers and I see warmth, wisdom and love emanating from your beautiful countenance. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. On days when the worries of tomorrow overwhelm me and make it impossible for me to climb out of bed, your counseling helps me rise and muster up the strength to combat the challenges of the world. You are not only my mother, but you are also my best friend, my North Star and my greatest motivator. When the hardships of my life seem to be unbearable, it’s in your arms that I find solace. When I am all lost and unable to make a decision, your words of wisdom show me the direction and help me stay focused. When situations get tough and I am on the verge of giving up, it’s your constant reminders to remain steadfast and have strong faith in the Almighty, that prevents me from relinquishing my objectives. Above all, you are my greatest well-wisher. After scooping accolades, when I return home all elated and brimming with joy, you are the first one to embrace me and rejoice at my success. As I sit at my desk, penning down my sentiments, I can’t help recalling the love and devotion with which you have taught me when I was little. The patience and dedication with which you have coached me have not only helped me soar in my academics, but also in all the endeavours of my life. The values and morals you have instilled in me have guided me, helped me distinguish between right and wrong, and have thus shaped my entire personality. The greatest achievement for me is when people praise me for taking after you, and I am all the more grateful to Allah for blessing me with such an amazing mother. You have always been my true protector and guide, ever since my birth. How can I not recount the numerous sleepless nights you’ve spent by my bed, praying for my health whenever I have fallen ill, or the anxiousness with which you have waited for me, after school and outside the examination halls? The most incredible part is that though this little daughter of yours is now a grown-up, your love for her has not faded away, instead it has amplified. Even today, I can see the anxiousness in your eyes when I am late from work, can feel the worry in your voice when I am unable to respond to your calls, and can discern your endearment when you cook delectable food items, especially for me. Maa, you have been a saviour throughout the ebbs and flows of my life’s struggles. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. Whether I needed a shoulder to cry on or a friend to confide in, an expert to offer me advice, or a buddy to celebrate my minuscule accomplishments, Maa, you have executed all these roles, flawlessly! I know no matter how hard I try, I can never be able to repay you for the amount of sacrifices you have made for me and for the unfaltering care, support and unconditional love you have showered on me. Nevertheless, with utmost gratitude, I pray to the Almighty Allah to bless you with abundant health and happiness, today and always. Ameen Happy Mother’s Day, Maa!

Known for her exceptional acting abilities, she captivates audiences with nuanced performances, whether portraying powerful characters like Saba Kareem in Meri Zaat Zarra-e-Benishan or subtly drawing attention as Udaari’s Sajo. Beyond the realm of acting, Samiya Mumtaz’s true passion lies in sustainable farming. Raised in an environment where creativity and social consciousness were valued, Mumtaz was drawn to the arts from a young age. ’’I did a lot of acting because my school encouraged it,“ she recalls. ’’And at home, my phuppo would write plays and we were the guinea pigs who would act them out.“ These early forays into acting ignited a spark and kicked off her acting career with the Ajoka Theatre, the voice of revolt against the establishment in Lahore. She also held a day job working with a research organisation. However, while acting provided an avenue for creative expression and her research work gave her profound satisfaction, a deeper yearning for a connection to nature and a desire to make an impact on society led her down the path of sustainable farming. “I grew up with a romanticised vision of living on a farm,” she smiles. “At 14, I daydreamed about going to fetch water and chirping with the birds. It was a pipe dream, but I held onto it, even as I pursued other endeavours.” While working at the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme, she found herself surrounded by voices urging her to turn her dreams into reality. “Why do you think this is just a dream? Why don’t you make it happen?” her friends queried. She sought guidance from a friend with a business background who helped her write out a feasibility study for an organic farm. Next, she immersed herself in learning traditional farming methods from farmers in her community. “I did not have an agricultural background and learnt along the way about techniques such as intercropping, composting, and green manuring.” As she navigated the complexities of farming on less-than-ideal land, her passion for nurturing the earth grew stronger. “The land I had was very saline and it was a challenge,” she admits. But she did turn the land around and then started an organic food business called Daali Earth. For Mumtaz, the decision to pursue acting alongside farming was a deliberate choice born out of financial necessity and a desire to balance her responsibilities. “My day job was satisfying, but I was not able to save much from what I earned,” she acknowledges. As a single mother with two children, she needed another source of income. In the end, she found solace in the balance, viewing each endeavour as a complementary expression of her creativity and commitment to making an impact. Reflecting on her experience in the local film industry, she remarks that “films barely have any existence in this country,” but acknowledges the challenges. “Pakistani films are made from the money people have in their pockets.” In a market dominated by international giants, Pakistani cinema struggles to compete, hindered by unaffordable ticket prices and limited accessibility. Mumtaz’s heart remains tethered to the stage, where the presence of a live audience breathes life into her performances. “My preferred medium is the stage with a live audience, any day,” she asserts while talking about a recent stage performance called The Story of Malika Pukhraj on the life of the legendary singer. Speaking about her venture into sustainable farming, she dwells on her dedication to organic practices and refusal to compromise on quality. From tilling the soil by hand to nurturing heirloom seeds, she is committed to organic practices, eschewing chemical inputs in favour of holistic, sustainable methods. However, despite her best efforts, the business faced several hurdles, including a limited market and financial constraints. As the challenges mounted and profitability remained elusive, she made the difficult decision to sell Daali Earth, recognising that scaling up would necessitate compromises she was unwilling to make. Although she may have exited the business world, Mumtaz’s passion for sustainable living remains. Today, she finds joy in tending to her farm, cultivating organic crops, and embracing the agrarian life. “There is great pleasure in picking your own vegetables and cooking them in your own oil.” Her days remain filled with purpose and productivity. Her mornings begin around six, and it is during these tranquil hours that she tends to the farm and engages in tasks like churning butter, fermenting vegetables, and making jams. “And if there is a TV shoot, I usually go there after my farm work is done.” Samiya Mumtaz’s journey is an inspiration for those who dare to pursue their passions against the odds. Through her dedication to both acting and sustainable farming, she exemplifies the power of resilience, creativity, and a commitment to living authentically.

According to meteorological forecasts, the precipitation in the Anhui region during this summer is expected to increase by 50 to 80 percent compared to the usual levels. The possible extreme rainfall-induced floods pose a great threat to the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute is utilizing digital tools and other technical expertise to carry out flood prevention and the maintenance of power grid equipment. On Thursday, at the inspection site of the Yungu 220 KV transformer substation in Hefei, Anhui province, maintenance personnel inspected goods and materials regarding flood prevention and uploaded related information. Technical staff members from the institute conducted statistical analysis of all units through the Anhui power grid disaster prevention platform. Those efforts provided robust support for power grid flood prevention. Power grid flood warning and prediction is a data-intensive task, and the institute is actively advancing the collection and integration of data in need. By gathering data from various sources such as the number forecast center, hydrological bureaus and meteorological departments, an intelligent algorithm system for warning of floods and geological disasters is being constructed. Through the use of data and positioning systems, disaster warnings of particular stations or lines can be achieved. Real-time risk prediction can be sent to front lines through the platform to help initiate flood prevention emergency responses, organize patrols and ensure timely access to flood information. Based on the inspection operation app, maintenance personnel can conduct inspections of low-lying substations, ground wire station buildings, foundational waterlogged poles or towers and other power grid facilities. All flood prevention risk information can be found at the disaster prevention platform. Utilizing digital methods to monitor and control the progress of risk management, they have achieved a full-process control from risk identification, to formulation of risk management plans and finally to the elimination of the risks. Additionally, based on the distribution of risks, a refined scheduling of flood prevention can be organized. Combining historical data on floods, flood-prone areas, and other relevant information, technical personnel from the institute utilized the disaster prevention platform to analyze high-risk power grid equipment in flood-prone areas. Innovative technologies such as three-eye cameras, videos and the precise monitoring of water levels within stations were employed to accurately monitor water levels. Furthermore, drone inspections and shared tower videos were utilized to achieve precise disaster monitoring across all areas at all time. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute, in line with the requirements of digital transformation in power grid flood prevention, has established a digital control system for power grid flood prevention processes. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by power grid flood prevention work in areas such as prediction, material transportation and on-site inspections during flood seasons. It enhanced the prediction and warning capabilities, promoted the usage of digital tools, and supports the digital transformation of the company. Copyright 1995 -  . All rights reserved.

The world body approved the Arab and Palestinian-sponsored resolution by a vote of 143-9 with 25 abstentions. It is Israel\'s relentless military offensive in Gaza since Oct 7 that has prompted more UN members to join the pro-Palestine group. A UN General Assembly resolution on Oct 27 calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza was approved 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Although the US can still veto Palestine\'s UN membership in the UN Security Council voting on the issue as it did on April 18, the result of the latest UN General Assembly vote reflects a wider support for full membership of Palestine in the UN, which means a greater pressure on Washington to act against the will of the world. US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood said on Friday that for the US to support Palestinian statehood, direct negotiations must guarantee Israel\'s security and future as a democratic Jewish state and that Palestinians can live in peace in a state of their own. But by saying that the US side just pretends to be blind to the fact that it is the Israeli side that has been recklessly killing the Palestinian people on their land. And even if the Hamas Oct 7 attack is taken into account, what the Israel has done in the region since the World War II must also be borne in mind as well, which clearly shows the right and wrong regarding the Palestinian question. The world can see clearly that the statehood of Israel has not only been fully guaranteed but also the country has prospered. In the process, it has continuously expanded its influences to the Palestinian side beyond the 1967 borders, and even invaded neighboring countries, including Syria and Lebanon. Over the years, Israel, as the occupying power, has technically eroded the foundation of the two-state solution. The current conflict, which has lasted for more than seven months, is more likely to completely ruin the prospects of the two-state solution agreed by the international community. So it is not the security or future of Israeli people that has become a question of grave concern, but that of the Palestinians, whose survival in Gaza has even become a question today thanks to Israel\'s aggression indulged and supported by Washington, not to mention the overdue statehood of their country. That Israel intensified its attack on Rafah on Saturday, under the US\' acquiescence, in response to the UN General Assembly the Palestine-related vote the previous day, presents a grave provocation to the common will of the international community, and also serves to put an end to its peace talks with Hamas in Cairo that has lasted for days, in which Hamas had made big concessions for a ceasefire. Israel should stop its collective punishment of the Gaza people, stop advancing its military offensive in Rafah, and effectively remove all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. In the West Bank, Israel should stop all settlement activities and effectively curb the intensifying settler violence. Palestine should enjoy the same status as Israel, and the Palestinian people should enjoy the same rights as the Israeli people. It is the common responsibility of the international community, including the US, to support and promote the process of Palestinian independent statehood and provide a strong guarantee for the implementation of the two-state solution and the realization of lasting peace in the Middle East. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the US should put aside its own interests and work for world peace and humanity, undertaking its global responsibility. The UN Security Council is a platform to resolve issues and not create divisions or hijack the global peace agenda for one\'s own narrow ends by abusing its veto power. Copyright 1995 -  .
