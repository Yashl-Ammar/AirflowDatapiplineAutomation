His family told industry publication Variety that he died on Thursday at his home in Santa Monica, California. "His films were revolutionary and iconoclastic, and captured the spirit of an age," their statement said. Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro are among the actors he helped develop. Directors James Cameron and Martin Scorsese cut their teeth on his films. Many of his films became cult classics and he became famous for the speed at which he worked, often making two films at the same location and at the same time, in order to save money. Roger Corman was born in Detroit on 5 April 1926. His father, William, was an engineer and he had intended to follow in his footsteps. However, while studying at college, he became attracted to film-making and after a spell working for General Motors quit his job and went to work at 20th Century Fox as a messenger boy. Having failed to make much progress, he set off for Europe where among other things, he briefly studied English literature at Oxford. He returned to the US with ambitions to become a screenwriter. He sold his first script, The House in the Sea, in 1953 and it was filmed as Highway Dragnet the following year with Corman being credited as co-producer. However, he was so upset by the changes made to his story that he scraped together some cash and set himself up as a producer. Corman began directing in 1955 with Swamp Women and over the next 15 years he made more than 50 films, gaining a reputation for the speed with which he could turn them out. It became something of a joke in the film industry that Corman could negotiate a contract from a public phone, shoot the film in the phone box and pay for it with the coins in the change slot. The 1960 release, The Little Shop of Horrors, which featured a brief appearance by a young Jack Nicholson, took just two days to shoot with Corman using the set of a previous film, Bucket of Blood. A stage musical based on the film opened in 1982 and would itself spawn a second film version four years later. Corman decided to widen his horizons with a series of films based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe and featuring Vincent Price as the lead in all but one of them. The House of Usher was released in 1960 and was followed by a string of others including The Raven, The Masque of the Red Death and The Tomb of Ligeia. His 1962 film, The Intruder, which examined racial tensions in America\'s Deep South, featured a young William Shatner and won an award at the Venice Film Festival. Despite this, the film flopped at the box office and became Corman\'s first film to make a loss, prompting him to remark that he\'d stick to making films that entertained rather than carried a social message. For a time he became part of the 1960s counter-culture, making biker film The Wild Angels, which starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra. He also directed The Trip, which was written by and starred Jack Nicholson. The film was seen as the precursor of Easy Rider, with both Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper featuring in the cast In the late 60s he set up his own production company, New World Pictures. As well as continuing to make budget movies, he also began handling films made by distinguished foreign film-makers, including Francois Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini and introducing them to an American audience. He sold New World Pictures in the 1980s but went on to form two more production companies. He also returned to the director\'s chair in 1990 with the film Frankenstein Unbound. Based on a Brian Aldiss novel, it starred John Hurt and Bridget Fonda and featured a brief appearance by Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the Australian band INXS. In 2009 he received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement and continued to work well into his eighties, producing the 2010 films Dinoshark and Sharktopus for the Syfy TV channel. The sheer quantity of films on which he worked is almost without precedent, as was his ability to find and nurture new talent. Many of his films have taken on cult status and few directors have been so successful at making popular pictures on such tight budgets. When asked how Corman would like to be remembered, he said, \'I was a filmmaker, just that,\'" the family said in their statement.

It took me a couple of rounds to find my rhythm, it was a tough fightâ\x80¦ but I enjoyed myself in there tonight. â\x80\x9cI am only going to get better. I am still learning.â\x80\x9d Price, also a former kickboxing world champion and international footballer, had made clear she felt she belonged on the biggest stage after being catapulted into the limelight in just her seventh paid fight. Fighting a mere 14 miles or so from her home town of Ystrad Mynach, Price was looking to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Joe Calzaghe, Enzo Maccarinelli and current world champion Joe Cordina who have all enjoyed winning nights in the Cardiff Arena. Cordina, who has twice won world titles in the Welsh capital, had implored Price to enjoy her moment being centre stage, warning that she might never again enjoy the chance to fight in front of her home fans. Price, who fought all over the world as an amateur, had never boxed professionally in Wales and the event, broadcast live on BBC Wales as the broadcaster showed a world title fight for the first time in 19 years, had a distinctly Welsh flavour. The 29-year old entered the ring to the Welsh football anthem Yma o Hyd â\x80\x93 perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with more than 50 Wales football caps - with former Welsh world champions Maccarinelli, Lee Selby, Steve Robinson and Barry Jones all in attendance at ringside. Lauren Price became world champion in just her seventh professional fight This was unquestionably the biggest night of Priceâ\x80\x99s professional career but she showed no signs of nerves as she sensibly looked to create space and distance against a fighter renowned for ploughing forward on the front foot. A cagey first session saw Price land the slightly cleaner shots, keeping her composure as she landed with a flurry of punches at the end of round two. McCaskill is a fighter who never takes a backward step but Price worked behind her jab and used her speed and movement to tag the American with a series of eye-catching shots. The Detroit fighter was warned for holding and pushing in the third round and she struggled to deal with Priceâ\x80\x99s relentless pace, with the Welsh boxer looking far more experienced than her six pro fight resume. Price and McCaskill had an accidental clash of heads in the fifth round that left huge swelling around McCaskillâ\x80\x99s left eye as the home fighter began to take control. Price, who dedicated her win to her grandmother Linda and late grandfather Derek, who raised her, says she wants to create a legacy for Welsh womenâ\x80\x99s boxing and winning her first world title is the first step. A unique athlete who wrote in a school letter aged just eight that she wanted to be a world kickboxing champion, international footballer and Olympian, Price is used to chasing her dreams and has become a world champion just 23 months after making her professional debut. The Rob McCracken-trained fighter had vowed that she would not allow McCaskill to turn the contest into a â\x80\x9cdogfightâ\x80\x9d and was true to her word as she used her superior defensive acumen and speed to dominate from start to finish. McCaskillâ\x80\x99s corner were having to work overtime to deal with the swelling above her left eye, with the American flying out of her corner in the sixth session in search of the one big punch she felt could stop the fight in an instant. However, Price was too composed to deviate from the gameplan and she continued to land the more telling blows as she continually tagged the champion on the inside before dancing out of reach. The latter rounds became far more attritional for Price with McCaskill desperately swinging haymakers as she looked for the one punch that could change the course of the fight and ensure she kept her titles. The fight was halted after Jessica McCaskill\'s eye was assessed by the ringside medic for a second time However, the damage to McCaskillâ\x80\x99s eye was too great with the ringside medic deciding at the start of round nine that McCaskill was unable to continue. â\x80\x9cBoxing has a new superstar,â\x80\x9d Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom said. Priceâ\x80\x99s trainer McCracken added that Price had done â\x80\x9cbrilliantly well,â\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9cis a credit to Wales". On the undercard, featherweight Rhys Edwards underlined his credentials as his undefeated record continued with a unanimous and clear points victory over experienced opponent Thomas Patrick Ward. Edwards is now 16-0 and won the WBA intercontinental title as he produced an eye-catchingly impressive display in front of his home fans. Edwardsâ\x80\x99 stablemates Kyran Jones and Kane Shepherd were also victorious, with Jones beating fellow Welshman Lewis Howells on points while Shepherd beat Ismael Ellis whose corner retired their fighter after a one-sided contest including a knockdown. There were also wins for heavyweights Moses Jolly and Hughie Fury, while Mark Jeffers knocked out Darren Johnstone in a middleweight contest, with Johnstone receiving oxygen in the ring. \'Generational talent\' Price ready to seize \'superstar\' moment \'Special athlete with a secret weapon\' - Price targets world title The Welsh boxer with enough siblings for a football team BBC Wales was given exclusive access to the Price camp in the days before the fight.

The Motorsport Ireland driver was pipped to victory by Spain\'s Jan Solans by a margin of just 3.2 seconds. McErlean, 24, was faster than Solans in a final stage shootout but came up just short of victory. "An incredible experience," said TokSport Skoda driver McErlean. "We have our first WRC2 podium, and no finer man to have beside me than James Fulton [McErlean\'s co-driver]. "Thanks to TokSport and Skoda for a great car but most of all, thank you to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy for always believing in me." McErlean, who was making his first WRC start of the season for TokSport Skoda, had swapped the lead with Solans on several occasions throughout the rally. The 24-year-old led by 0.1 seconds with two stages remaining, but Solans hit back and was fastest by 6.5 seconds on the penultimate stage. McErlean posted the fastest time on the final run by 3.2 seconds, but fell short of a first win by the same margin. Solans and McErlean had capitalised on accidents from experienced leaders Oliver Solberg and Gus Greensmith earlier in the event but, in truth, the pair showed great speed throughout the rally and were deserving of podium finishes. McErlean\'s performance was enough to finish ninth overall in the rally, which was won by the Rally1 machine of Sebastien Ogier. There was misfortune for Northern Ireland\'s William Creighton and Kris Meeke, who both retired on Saturday. Junior WRC champion Creighton restarted to finish the rally in 12th place in WRC2. Josh McErlean\'s first WRC2 podium feels like it had been a long time coming. He has long been tipped to challenge at the front, but Rally Portugal was a coming-of-age performance when he kept a cool head and highlighted blistering pace, while many more experienced rivals faltered. The switch from Hyundai to Skoda has already paid off and he starts his WRC2 in style, and his confidence will only grow from here. A lot was made of Motorsport Ireland\'s failed bid to secure a round of the World Rally Championship, due to a failure to get government funding - something the Rally Northern Ireland bid knows all too well - but its academy drivers show the island of Ireland has a lot to offer the world stage after the passing of the late, great Craig Breen. McErlean\'s podium was also a poignant moment, as the 24-year-old had been mentored by Breen, who was also navigated by Fulton before his passing. Fellow academy driver William Creighton is making good progress in the WRC2 class after taking the Junior WRC title last year, and Motorsport Ireland-backed drivers Jon Armstrong and Aoife Raftery are also impressing in the European championship.

He made the remarks at a pre-budget conference in Lahore, two days after  Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government would limit its business only to strategic and essential SOEs under its domain but their number would be reduced from 40 after scrutiny. Chairing the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) meeting, which was attended by the finance minister, Dar said privatisation of loss-making SOEs would be a priority. The meeting noted that 40 SOEs were currently categorised as strategic or essential, but respective ministries would submit their details to the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOE). The CCoSOE will determine the status of the SOEs to be categorised as strategic or essential entities. Speaking on Sunday, Aurangzeb said: “There is no such as [a] strategic SOE.” Talking about the meeting chaired by Dar on Friday, he continued, “We are absolutely on the same wavelength — that there is no such thing as a strategic SOE.” The finance minister said that a meeting would be held tomorrow where “we will go back to various ministries and say that all this should be handed over to the private sector”. “There will be public-private partnership and we will accelerate the privatisation agenda,” he said. Commenting on concerns regarding the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Aurangzeb said the government was not just looking at foreign investors. “They are local and foreign investors who are bidding […] there is no such thing that we are only looking at foreign investors,” he said. Commenting on a fresh loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, he said that a larger and longer programme was needed to bring “permanence in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms”. He also talked about energy reforms, saying that there were “leakages” and stressed the need for stopping theft. He said that changes were being brought to the boards of distribution companies (Discos) in order to bring in those from the private sector for “better corporate governance”. “And then you will see how we bring those Discos towards concessions or privatisation or a combination of both,” he emphasised.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Esther Perez Ruiz, the Fund’s resident representative for Pakistan, said: “A mission team led by Nathan Porter, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan, will meet with authorities next week to discuss the next phase of engagement. “The aim is to lay the foundation for better governance and stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economic growth that will benefit all Pakistanis,” she added. Pakistan last month completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but the government has stressed the need for a fresh, longer-term programme. Last week, the Fund said that a mission was expected to visit Pakistan this month to “discuss the FY25 budget, policies, and reforms under a potential new programme for the welfare of all Pakistanis”. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the $350bn economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. On Friday, the Fund said that downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the IMF in its staff report following the second and final review under the standby agreement. The Fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements. Additional input from Reuters Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon.

AJK witnessed violent clashes between the police and activists of a rights movement amid a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the territory on Friday and Saturday, which left at least one police official dead and more than 90 others injured, officials told Dawn.com on Saturday. Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali had said that Sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest in the town of Islamgarh, where he was deployed to stop a rally for Muzaffarabad under the banner of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC). The JAAC, which has traders at the forefront in most parts of the state, has been seeking the provision of electricity as per hydropower generation cost in AJK, subsidised wheat flour and an end to the privileges of the elite class. They called for the strike following the arrest of at least 70 of their members in raids on Thursday. Reports emerged in the wake of the protests on Sunday that three Rangers battalions had entered the territory through Kohala and were awaiting further orders. However, AJK Minister for Rural Development Faisal Mumtaz Rathore confirmed that the Rangers, due to the intervention of President Asif Zardari, were “called back as soon as they entered Azad Kashmir” since the situation had calmed down. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, former prime minister of AJK Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi slammed the deployment, calling it a “drama” and an attempt to score political points. “First they send them, then call them back, what is this?” the ex-AJK PM said. “Those fighting for their rights and engaging in protest are free to do so, but they must remain peaceful,” Niazi said in a press conference. He added that they (the protestors) must not give the “enemy” a chance to sow discord within the territory and create infighting. In a post on Facebook, Rathore acknowledged the public demands for cheap electricity, but admitted that addressing them was “out of his hands”. “The big demand of the people, the demand for cheap electricity and the end of loadshedding, falls under the jurisdiction of the Government of Pakistan,” Rathore said. Urging the public to remain peaceful, he said, “In this one year [I have been in office], I have never been against the right to peaceful protest and [never] supported violence against people.” In the aftermath of the protests, JAAC leader Shaukat Nawaz Mir reiterated that the committee is a peaceful organisation and willing to negotiate with the authorities to ensure the provision of cheap electricity and cheap flour. He also appreciated the withdrawal of the Rangers from the area. “We have planned another shutter-down strike,” he told reporters on Sunday. “We have been peaceful for the last year and always will be a peaceful movement. This territory and its institutions and police are our own.” Mir maintained that the JAAC is advocating for the rights of the public in AJK, “but it is the bureaucrats who do not understand the public’s needs that are doing the damage”. The JAAC is peaceful and open to negotiations, Mir added, requesting to be notified by the authorities about decisions taken. “We do not want to hurt anyone.” He also slammed the federal government for not cutting down spending while at the same time claiming they have no room in the budget to subsidise electricity or flour. “The government claims they can’t provide cheap electricity and flour because they have no budget, but they have the money for watches and cars,” Mir said, adding that the federal government and the prime minister should be “ashamed”. “I don’t want my forum to be controversial,” Mir said. “We are made up of respectable politicians … the local council is standing with us”. The JAAC leader added that the movement was successful since members of multiple parties and councils “are on our side”. “Our nation is conscious now. There is no politics here, we just want our rights and identity.” Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said Israeli airstrikes pounded parts of northern, central and southern Gaza during the night and into Sunday morning. In Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city which sits on the Egyptian border, the Kuwaiti hospital said on Sunday it had received the bodies of “18 martyrs” killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported at least two fatalities, a father and son, both doctors, in a strike on Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Mourners react next to the body of a Palestinian killed in Israeli strikes at Al-Aqsa hospital, in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip on May 12. — Reuters A full-scale Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah “cannot take place”, the UN human rights chief insisted, saying it could not be reconciled with international law, AFP reports. “The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!” Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement. “These exhausted, famished people, many of whom have been displaced many times already, have no good options. He said a full-scale offensive could have a “catastrophic impact […] including the possibility of further atrocity crimes.” “I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.” Volker said he was deeply distressed by fast-deteriorating conditions in Gaza, saying the latest evacuation orders had triggered “massive displacement of an already profoundly traumatised population”. He said the towns supposed to receive those displaced from Rafah had already been “reduced to rubble”. Turk also voiced concern at reports of indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza.\nHe said a full-scale offensive on Rafah “cannot take place” and called on all states with influence to do everything in their power to prevent it. He also called on Israel and Palestinian armed groups to agree on a ceasefire, and for all hostages to be released immediately. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned Israel against expanding its military operations to Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “We consider an offensive on Rafah […] to be irresponsible,” Scholz said on a talk show organised by the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group in Potsdam just outside Berlin. “We warn against this, and we do not believe that there is any concept that will ultimately lead to this happening without incredible human losses in terms of innocent civilians,” he said. The German chancellor added that humanitarian aid must also be brought to Gaza, and there must be a perspective for peaceful coexistence in which two states can exist side by side. The health ministry in Gaza said that at least 35,034 people have been killed in the territory during more than seven months of Israeli bombardment, AFP reports. The toll includes at least 63 deaths over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,755 people have been wounded in the Gaza Strip since October 7. Months after Israel said it had dismantled Hamas’ command structure in northern Gaza — devastated by intense violence in the early stages of the offensive — fighting has resumed in recent days in Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City’s Zeitun neighbourhood. AFP correspondents reported intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters in the Zeitun area early on Sunday, with medics and witnesses saying troops were engaged in combat in Zeitun as well as Jabalia. A displaced Palestinian woman, who fled Jabalia after the Israeli military called on residents to evacuate, carries her belongings on her head as she makes her way towards Gaza City on May 12. — Reuters Britain’s foreign minister David Cameron has said Israel should not carry out an offensive in the Gazan city of Rafah without a “clear plan” to protect people, AFP reports. “For there to be a major offensive in Rafah, there would have to be an absolutely clear plan about how you save lives, how you move people out the way, how you make sure they’re fed, you make sure that they have medicine and shelter and everything,” he told Sky News television. “We have seen no such plan … so we don’t support an offensive in that way,” he added. Cameron said Israel needed to “do better” in allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. “I’ve said many times that I’m not content with the action Israel has taken over humanitarian aid,” he said, adding there are “some signs” of improvement, “but not fast enough”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged an immediate halt to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, the return of hostages and a “surge” in humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “I repeat my call, the world’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages and an immediate surge in humanitarian aid,” Guterres said in a video address to an international donors’ conference in Kuwait. “But a ceasefire will only be the start. It will be a long road back from the devastation and trauma of this war”, he added. “The war in Gaza is causing horrific human suffering, devastating lives, tearing families apart and rendering huge numbers of people homeless, hungry and traumatised,” Guterres said. His remarks were played at the opening of the conference in Kuwait organised by the International Islamic Charitable Organisation (IICO) and the UN’s humanitarian coordination organisation OCHA. In the course of the past 24 hours, there is clear pressure being exerted by the Israeli military on three fronts inside the Gaza Strip, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reports from Deir Al Balah. They have been maximising pressure on Rafah, the middle area as well as the north of the territory, he says, highlighting that the Israeli military has passed an evacuation order for residents of the Jabalia refugee camp and in the central areas of Rafah. The Israeli military has started to intensify the bombardment of the Jabalia camp in the past couple of hours, destroying residential houses and attacking evacuation centres, the report said. They say they are trying to completely eliminate Hamas battalions there despite a previous announcement that said they had managed to take military control in the north of this Strip, it added. Smoke billows during Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip from a position in southern Israel on May 12. — AFP Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram has asserted that the adoption of a resolution advocating Palestine’s full membership in the United Nations by a large majority would ramp up political pressure on the United States to reassess its position within the Security Council. The UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on Friday with 143 votes. The US and eight other countries voted against the resolution, while 25 abstained. Three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — China, France, and Russia — voted for the resolution. Britain abstained. Among US allies, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Spain, and Mexico voted for the resolution, while Germany and Canada abstained. All South Asian nations — Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan — voted in favour. Almost all Arab and other Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, also voted for the resolution. Read more here. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Imad Abu Zayda, an emergency doctor in Gaza’s Jabalia, said: “No light due to the lack of fuel and there’s no medical supplement available as Israel has expanded their operation in the area. We have no oxygen to give to patients. “Most of the injuries are children and women. We are operating with minimum facilities,” the doctor added. Israel has launched strikes on Gaza after it expanded an evacuation order for Rafah, with AFP correspondents reporting intense clashes and heavy gunfire from Israeli helicopters near Gaza City. Witnesses said Israel had carried out strikes in Rafah near the crossing with Egypt on Saturday, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Residents piled water tanks, mattresses and other belongings onto vehicles and prepared to flee again. Residents were told to go to the “humanitarian zone” of Al-Mawasi, on the coast northwest of Rafah. “We don’t know where to go,” said Farid Abu Eida, who was preparing to leave Rafah, having already been displaced there from Gaza City. “There is no place left in Gaza that is safe or not overcrowded… There’s nowhere we can go.” Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said “we have eliminated dozens of terrorists in eastern Rafah” and the army claimed troops were fighting “armed terrorists” at the crossing and had found “numerous underground tunnel shafts”. Gaza’s civil defence agency has said that two doctors were killed in an Israeli air strike on the city of Deir Al Balah in a central area of the Palestinian territory, AFP reports. “The bodies of Doctor Muhammad Nimr Qazaat and his son, Doctor Youssef, were recovered (as they were killed) because of an Israeli raid on the city of Deir Al Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and they were transferred to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah,” the agency said in a statement. The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Music fans who gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday to watch the Eurovision contest decried juries’ snubs of Israel as “obviously political”, AFP reports. The mood was electric at the packed Layla bar in Tel Aviv as the show got underway, with the crowd going wild when Israel’s contestant Eden Golan appeared on screen. As votes started ticking in, and it became clear that few of the juries representing the 37 countries with voting rights were offering Golan even a handful of votes, spirits fell. Fans went from jumping around and waving Israeli flags to sitting downcast, some with their heads in their hands. “This is clearly political,” said Guy, a 20-year-old who declined to give his last name. “Eden was amazing… But there are people who hate us. They don’t see the whole picture,” he told AFP. “We didn’t get much from the countries. That’s obviously a political thing,” Layla manager Tal Shur agreed. Switzerland’s Nemo has won the Eurovision Song Contest, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel’s participation during the conflict in Gaza, AFP reports. Twenty-four-year-old Nemo’s “The Code” won the highest score from nations’ juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden’s Malmo. “I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world,” a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy. Nemo, Baby Lasagna and Israel’s contestant Eden Golan, had been bookmaker favourites to win the competition, watched around the world by millions of lovers of pop music — and kitschy shows. When Golan went on stage to perform her “Hurricane”, both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena. Boos could also be heard while Israel delivered its points to other acts and any time a country gave “Hurricane” high scores. Golan finished fifth with 375 points. This year’s winner Nemo, representing Switzerland, speaks during a press conference after the final of the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) at Malmö Arena, in Malmö, Sweden on May 12. — AFP Israel has hit parts of Gaza including Rafah where it expanded an evacuation order, as the UN warned an outright invasion of the crowded city risked an “epic” disaster, AFP reports. AFP journalists, medics and witnesses reported strikes across the coastal territory, where the UN says humanitarian relief is blocked after Israeli troops defied international opposition and entered eastern Rafah this week. That effectively shut a key aid crossing and suspended traffic through another. At least 21 people were killed during strikes in central Gaza and taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah city, a hospital statement said. Bodies covered in white dust lay on the ground in a courtyard of the facility. A man in a baseball cap leaned over one body bag, clasping a dust-covered hand that protruded. The feet of another corpse poked from under a blanket bearing the picture of a large teddy bear. In Rafah, witnesses reported intense air strikes near the crossing with Egypt, and AFP images showed smoke rising over the city. Other strikes occurred in north Gaza, witnesses said. Hamas has accused Israel of “expanding the incursion into Rafah to include new areas in the centre and the west of the city”. A woman sits next to belongings, as Palestinians prepare to evacuate, after Israeli forces launched a ground and air operation in the eastern part of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on May 11. — Reuters Israel’s military has said that a new field hospital has been established in the central Gaza Strip and is being run by a non-governmental organisation, the International Medical Corp, Reuters reports. “The field hospital will be operated by 150 international medical aid workers and its dozens of beds can be used for emergency and routine medical treatment,” the military said in a statement. The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees has released images of heavily damaged or destroyed schools it runs in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where many Palestinians have been forcibly displaced after the Israeli invasion of Rafah, Al Jazeera reports. “The classrooms are torched. Walls are blown out. There is rubble everywhere,” it said, adding there is no real safety or shelter at these schools. “This situation is unfolding under the world’s watch. Enough is enough.” Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the entry of aid into Gaza from the Rafah crossing due to Israel’s “unacceptable escalation”, Egypt’s state-affiliated Alqahera News satellite TV has reported, citing a senior official. Reuters reports the official also said that Egypt held Israel responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the Gaza Strip. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has discussed the dire situation in Gaza with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, with the officials agreeing that a full-scale Israeli military operation in Rafah would have catastrophic consequences and must be prevented, Al Jazeera reports quoting UN read-out. Guterres expressed “deep appreciation for Qatar’s continued mediation efforts to broker a deal for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza and the immediate release of hostages”, the statement added. The Israeli army has said rockets were launched from Rafah in southern Gaza towards the Kerem Shalom crossing, which was temporarily shut earlier this week after deadly fire, AFP reports. “Four launches were identified that crossed from the Rafah area”, the military said in a statement, adding that one rocket was intercepted by Israeli air defences “and the rest fell in open areas” around Kerem Shalom. It added that “no injuries were reported.” Weeks after attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration, Egyptian-American student Layla Sayed received a text message from a friend drawing her attention to a website dedicated to exposing people it says promote hatred of Jews and Israel. “I think they found you from the protest,” the friend wrote. When Sayed visited the site, called Canary Mission, she found a photo from the October 16 rally at the University of Pennsylvania with red arrows pointing to her among the demonstrators. The post included her name, the two cities she lives in, details about her studies and links to her social media accounts. Read more from Reuters here. Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, has released a video of a man held hostage in Gaza and seen alive in the footage, AFP reports. The man is seen speaking in the 11-second clip, which is superimposed with text in Arabic and Hebrew that reads: “Time is running out. Your government is lying”. The health ministry in Gaza has said that at least 34,971 people have been killed in the Palestinian enclave during Israel’s military bombardment in Gaza, AFP reports. The tally includes at least 28 deaths in the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 78,641 people have been wounded since fighting broke out on October 7. Saheb al-Hams, a hospital director in Rafah, has said that “sadly” the Kuwaiti Specialty Hospital in Rafah city “is now included in the places threatened with evacuation” following Israel’s latest order, Al Jazeera reports. “There is no other place for patients and injured people to go to but this hospital,” al-Hams said in a video message to journalists. The director called for “immediate international protection” for the medical facility. Palestinian Ambassador to the UK Husam Zomlot expressed his appreciation for Harvard students renaming a building after one of his relatives. His wife’s cousin Sidra Hassoun is “one of 14,500 children murdered in Israel’s genocide in Gaza.” In a post on X, he added that he is “proud of these students and all students everywhere” for supporting the Palestinian cause.', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'Canada arrests fourth Indian national in killing of Sikh activist - World - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'A fourth Indian national was charged by Canadian authorities on Saturday in the 2023 killing of a separatist Sikh leader in Vancouver. Amandeep Singh, 22, was already being held for unrelated gun charges before being charged with “first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder” in the slaying of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Three other Indian nationals were arrested this month. The killing sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau linked Indian intelligence to the killing. Nijjar — who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 — had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged “terrorism” and conspiracy to commit murder — allegations he denied. He was shot dead on June 18, 2023, by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver. Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had “credible allegations” connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying. India dismissed the allegations as “absurd” and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning. The shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China’s growing influence. US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India’s top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported in April. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two per cent of the country’s population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan.

A powerful solar storm — which could continue into Sunday — has triggered spectacular celestial shows usually confined to the far northern reaches of the planet, hence their nickname of the “northern lights”. “I have the sensation of living through a historic night in France […] It was really charged, with solar particles and emotions,” Eric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Observatoire de Cote d’Azur, wrote on social media after the first night. “Find good spots, away from the lights, with a clear view to the north!” Late on Saturday evening, pictures again started trickling onto social media as people in the United States reported sightings, though not as strong as Friday night’s. The first of several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun —  came just after 4pm GMT on Friday, according to the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). It was later upgraded to an “extreme” geomagnetic storm —  the first since the “Halloween Storms” of October 2003 that caused blackouts in Sweden and damaged power infrastructure in South Africa. Friday’s storm was listed as hitting level five geomagnetic conditions — the highest on the scale. Saturday saw G3 to G5 conditions, with G4 or higher conditions predicted Sunday and G3 conditions possible into Monday. But no major disruptions to power or communications networks appear to have been reported this time around, despite initial worries from authorities. There have only been “preliminary reports of power grid irregularities, degradation to high-frequency communications, GPS and possibly satellite navigation,” the SWPC said. Elon Musk, whose Starlink satellite internet operator has some 5,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, said his satellites were “under a lot of pressure, but holding up so far”. However China’s National Centre for Space Weather issued a “red alert” on Saturday morning, warning the storm will impact communications and navigation in most areas of the country, state news agency Xinhua reported. Auroras were visible in the northern half of the country, according to media reports. Excitement over the phenomenon —  and otherworldly photos of pink, green and purple night skies —  popped up across the world, from Mont Saint-Michel on the French coast to Payette, Idaho — in the western United States — to Australia’s island state of Tasmania. People pose for photos as a geomagnetic storm lights up the night sky above the Bonneville Salt Flats on May 10 in Wendover, Utah. — AFP Unlike solar flares, which travel at the speed of light and reach Earth in around eight minutes, CMEs travel at a more sedate pace, with officials putting the current average at 800 kilometres per second. The CMEs emanated from a massive sunspot cluster that is 17 times wider than our planet. People with eclipse glasses can also look for the sunspot cluster during the day. The Sun is approaching the peak of an 11-year cycle that brings heightened activity. NOAA’s Brent Gordon encouraged the public to try to capture the night sky with phone cameras even if they couldn’t see auroras with their naked eyes. “You’d be amazed at what you see in that picture versus what you see with your eyes.” Fluctuating magnetic fields associated with geomagnetic storms induce currents in long wires, including power lines, which can potentially lead to blackouts. Long pipelines can also become electrified, leading to engineering problems. Spacecraft are also at risk from high doses of radiation, although the atmosphere prevents this from reaching Earth. NASA has a dedicated team looking into astronaut safety and can ask astronauts on the International Space Station to move to places within the outpost that are better shielded. Even pigeons and other species that have internal biological compasses could be affected. Pigeon handlers have noted a reduction in birds coming home during geomagnetic storms, according to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The most powerful geomagnetic storm in recorded history, known as the Carrington Event after British astronomer Richard Carrington, occurred in September 1859.

Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

Copyright © 2024, Dawn NewsKit Publishing Platform', 'source': 'Dawn'}, {'title': 'FIFA’S FOUL ON PAKISTAN FOOTBALL - Newspaper - DAWN.COM', 'description': 'Apathy, manipulation and intrigue seem to define Pakistan football. While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders. But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well. FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone — including over interference in the PFF elections. Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a “Normalisation Committee” (NC) in 2019. It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board. But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way. One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it — Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik — is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket’s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport. This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF — even after his departure following elections for a new governing body — and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains. Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport. But is a franchise system like cricket’s PSL the best way forward? And why is an interim football administration pushing for it? FAR FROM NORMALISED On a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi’s north. There was an extravagant ceremony before the match, with fireworks aplenty.\xa0\xa0It was the opening match of the Ramazan Gold Cup. Sights like these have become few and far between in Pakistan football and the PFF had nothing to do with it. This tournament had been organised privately, with domestic football activity having become non-existent in the country. The Pakistan Premier Football League (PPFL), the country’s top-tier competition, hasn’t been held by the PFF since 2018. It’s something that has irked Pakistan’s history-making head coach Stephen Constantine. Constantine — who has been demanding that the league be restarted — wasn’t in attendance at the Naya Nazimabad Football Stadium, however. The 61-year-old Englishman was in Lahore, overseeing the national team’s preparations for its upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan. A day earlier in Lahore, Constantine was visibly irate during an interaction with reporters. Peppered with questions regarding Pakistan’s chances against Jordan — who had recently ended as runners-up in the Asian Cup — the English coach was blunt and unforgiving. Time and again, Constantine has reiterated that it is fundamentally important that Pakistan revives its league structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition. Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp. He was merely repeating himself six months on. He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year. For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league. “I just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,” he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny — disputed at several levels — carried out by the stopgap NC. “You don’t need every district to be part of the league. We had a Challenge Cup with 32 teams. Just take 16 teams from it and start the bloody league.” What Constantine doesn’t know is that the PFF’s internal problems aren’t the only impediment to the revival and resumption of the domestic league. More than a year before his appointment as the chairman of the FIFA appointed ‘Normalisation Committee’ in December 2021, Haroon Malik visited the FIFA headquarters in Zurich for a ‘secret meeting’ that would determine the future trajectory of Pakistan football. GAMING THE SYSTEM To be fair, Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 — which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA — to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all. This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country’s and clubs’ abysmal performance in international competitions. The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC. One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee’s association, remains disputed. In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote — against the PFF Constitution — in the ongoing district elections. These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF’s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections. A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community. There’s a method to the madness, however. Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations. Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo). The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president. Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women’s national championship. With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate’s favour. With clubs — that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 — set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs. The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency. In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time. Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year. To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA’s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik’s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021. In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football. Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out\nof the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. Pakistan head coach Stephen Constantine with his players during a training session at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium in Islamabad in November 2023: the Englishman has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the lack of regular domestic football in the country | White Star THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF PAKISTAN FOOTBALL On a cold December afternoon in 2019, Haroon Malik posed for a picture outside the FIFA headquarters in Zurich. “Discussing Pakistan football! Invigorating meetings, exciting times!” he captioned the picture on X, then known as Twitter. The discussions that took place in the Swiss city on that day would shape the future of Pakistan football. Plans for it had been set in motion months before. In August 2019, a month before FIFA first announced the NC for the PFF, global professional services firm KPMG had begun reaching out to people with knowledge of Pakistan football. During its initial correspondence, the KPMG Football Benchmark department said that it had started “an exciting project on football in Pakistan for a prominent client.” When discussions began, it emerged that it wanted to discuss the holding of a franchise league in Pakistan. Around that same time, a Facebook page was launched by the name of Football Club Pakistan (FCPK). Those working for the page aimed at providing football updates and were employed by media communications company Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan — the Pakistan branch of Starcom, which is headquartered in Chicago and which, in turn, is a subsidiary of global marketing and communication giants Publicis Groupe. FCPK was Malik’s first foray into Pakistan football. Some 15 months after FCPK was launched, the Canadian-Pakistani tech entrepreneur was named the chairman of the PFF Normalisation Committee, following the resignation of his predecessor Humza Khan. But it is what Malik was doing in those intervening months that made his appointment one that raises issues of conflict of interest. A FOOTBALLING CHESSBOARD Back in 2019, leading the discussions on that “exciting project on football in Pakistan” was KPMG’s former sports advisory manager, Yacine Sosse Alaoui. Alaoui has since left KPMG, joining FIFA as its business intelligence manager in September 2020. But a little over six months earlier, in February 2020, Alaoui and Andrea Sartori, the head of KPMG Football Benchmark, had accompanied Malik for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, where they met with officials from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) about what Malik called “discussing opportunities and ideas for Pakistan football.” Malik had not been named as head of the NC at that time. “Haroon Malik came to the AFC in 2020 with people from KPMG,” a source in Asian football’s governing body told Eos. “Discussions with the marketing department centred on\xa0a\xa0competition.” When\xa0the AFC was asked about that visit, a spokesperson of Asia’s football governing body termed it “a courtesy visit.” In fact, it was the December 2019 meeting in Zurich that had reportedly set up discussions with the AFC. The FIFA headquarters is a seven-storey building: two floors above ground and five underground. It was a closed-doors secret meeting on one of those levels that would script the future of Pakistan football. In alleged attendance alongside Sartori, Alaoui and Malik were Mario Gallavotti, the Italian lawyer who heads FIFA’s independent committees; Romy Gai, the chairman of London-based sports industry operators AWE International Group; and Pakistani advertising mogul Raihan Merchant. The proposal was laid out for holding a franchise league in Pakistan with Gallavotti and Gai — who would in 2022 become FIFA’s chief business officer — on board. Their interests remain unknown, but the talk in FIFA at that time was “that something big was going to happen in Pakistan football.” Sartori, Gai and Gallavotti are all Italian. When FIFA was approached for comment in 2022 regarding that meeting, its spokesperson gave a stern reply: “Please be informed that there are no updates regarding the matter you’ve mentioned.” The world football body did not comment on whether Gallavotti and Gai were part of that meeting, although they did not deny it either. Meanwhile Merchant, when contacted by Eos, denied his presence at the meeting. A source close to the discussion, however, says otherwise: “They [Gallavotti and Gai] were really pushing for the league to happen,” the source told\xa0Eos. “The purpose of the meeting seemed to push for its endorsement.” It was clear that Malik and his associates didn’t want to come out as rebels.\xa0They wanted to hold the league with the PFF’s blessings, as part of the domestic calendar, but also as sole holders of all rights for the event. Football was going to be the third sports discipline Z2C Limited — the holding company for ventures owned by Merchant, which also has Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan, now Brainchild Communications — was going to organise a league for. Malik has been an executive director at Z2C since January 2019 — a position he still holds. Merchant and Malik also are alumni of the same university. Malik’s FCPK would become the ideal social media tool to propagate the league. Meanwhile, Z2C also had BSports — a sports app that combined social and data feeds with a livestream of sports events. It also had digital rights for the Pakistan Super League. The question being raised is whether Malik’s interest is in putting the affairs of the PFF in order as head of the NC or to push forward the franchise league he is invested in. Haroon Malik’s Instagram post showing him at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on December 5, 2019, more than a year before his appointment by FIFA as the NC chairman | Instagram/roon.toon FIFA’S ROLE While giving another nine-month extension to Haroon Malik and his team till March 2024 — originally the NC had been appointed in September 2019 till June 2020, while Haroon was appointed the NC chairman in January 2021, for a nine-month period — FIFA\xa0had\xa0warned of possible sanctions being imposed if PFF elections weren’t held by then. But despite little headway being made and multiple deadlines being missed, FIFA has once again extended its mandate till December 2024. “Of course, it’s those links high up in FIFA,” one source close to the matter tells\xa0Eos. “With Haroon there, the franchise league plan stays alive.” In the meantime, most former Starcom employees are now working for the PFF, a simple LinkedIn search will show. Hasnain Haider, PFF’s head of digital media, was a project manager at Starcom. PFF’s football performance analyst, Irtaza Hussain, was community manager for FCPK at Starcom. PFF’s current creative manager, Haider Ali, was formerly at Z2C. While the NC has been unable to pay dues to players of the national teams because of an audit objection raised by FIFA, the employees continue to get paid by funds coming in from the global football body. “The PFF is effectively being run by Starcom,” a source in the NC tells\xa0Eos. “The groundwork is being laid for the franchise league they want to hold.” Malik, though, hasn’t been the only one looking to organise a football league in Pakistan. UK-based TouchSky Group, Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa football official Shahid Shinwari have all publicly stated their intentions of doing so as well. TouchSky, later rebranded as Global Soccer Ventures and now repackaged as Pakistan Football League, is set to unveil its franchise league next month. It has set a date of November 1 to hold its franchise league which, contrary to the brochures it has been sending out, does not have the endorsement of the English Premier League\xa0or\xa0its\xa0clubs. But with the PFF having the final say over any league, Haroon’s position as the NC chief, which will see him hold elections for a new executive committee of the country’s football governing body, means there is a conflict of interest, even if he says that FIFA doesn’t think there is any. “Anyone associated with football, anywhere in the world, would have some stake in the game,” Haroon told\xa0Eos\xa0in April 2021. “It is normal, and natural. You cannot have someone who knows nothing about football, nothing about the market that they are operating in, and be responsible for football. Employers determine if conflict of interests are potentially troublesome. FIFA determined that my commercial interests have no conflict with this role [as NC chief]. If FIFA is okay, then that is the final word.” In fact, FIFA did not specifically comment on Haroon’s commercial interests having a conflict with his role, but its spokesperson said that “in\xa0line with standard procedures, all members of the Normalisation Committee were subject to stringent eligibility checks.” The spokesperson did not disclose whether FIFA had knowledge of Haroon’s elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: “FIFA has no further comment at this stage.” TAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSL In 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL. Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league. But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later. Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines. With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren’t the only ones. For some time, Badar “Bobby” Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C’s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021. “They just can’t get it together,” he said. Badar has been involved in almost every sport — from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships. “Working on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],” he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL. Puyol’s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan. Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky — who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event — had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League. The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan. TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon’s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed. ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES? Haroon Malik’s and Z2C’s plans had already taken off the ground by then. Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed. And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik’s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared — thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s key advisers. But Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league — only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months. Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports. “Looking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,” Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL. “A hybrid model transitioning into promotion/relegation makes sense to me. [America’s] Major League Soccer, [Japan’s] J-League is a good conversation starter.” Malik expanded on this: “So many possibilities. Bottom line — either one is good for the players! Get them playing! Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast. Not insurmountable!” When asked why a traditional league model — which would see the country’s football club culture thrive — might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, “We are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere.” However, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies. Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football. Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions. The Major League Soccer (MLS) — a franchise league system — has achieved huge popularity in the United States. The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year. In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country’s national league. Its current season, which began in September, will culminate\xa0in\xa0May. Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their\xa0programmes. This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides. With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC’s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions. Malik, however, believes that wouldn’t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him. “Setting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,” he said during that exchange. “Once that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place.” Malik’s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast. But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration. When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate. The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process. Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik’s control of the election process and the federation. TIME TO TURN A CORNER Such control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik’s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition. If a candidate they’re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped. It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C. “Gallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA’s inner circle, closest to Infantino,” one source in the global football body tells\xa0Eos. “If they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later.” FIFA’s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence. The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC’s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history. But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country’s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable. Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country. When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan — Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC — for the event. A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan’s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand. The NC later stated that the clubs weren’t interested in participating at the SAFF event. It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations. Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one. As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA’s inner circle.

The documentary shed light on various aspects of the life of Dr Aafia from her birth, education, marriage and to her kidnapping in Karachi and confinement in a notorious US prison. View this post on Instagram Aafia’s sister Dr Fowzia Siddiqui and Muslim Matters’ Editor-in-chief Hena Zuberi and others spoke at the event. Dr Fowzia said that her sister Dr Aafia was a gifted child, a bright scholar and a loving and caring person. She got a PhD degree in neurosciences from Brandies University of the US and it was her dream to revolutionise education system in Pakistan. In the documentary, human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, who currently represents Dr Aafia, said a vast majority of the American people had no idea who Dr Aafia was and they also did not care. He said that she has suffered a lot in the US prison and braved all sorts of torture. El-Hajj Mauri Saalakhan, the founding president and director of operations at The Aafia Foundation, told the documentary makers that after 9/11, the US targeted the human rights and liberties of people, especially Muslims. He said Dr Aafia also fell prey to this victimisation and in 2003 she was kidnapped, along with her children, in Karachi and got disappeared on mere suspicion that her husband had bought online night vision goggles. Umme Muhammad, the president of the Musawemem Campaign, said for the last 15 years she had been linked to the case of Dr Aafia but disappointingly nothing more could be achieved. She said Dr Aafia was targeted only because she was Muslim. Yvonne Ridley was amongst the first investigative journalists who told the world that Dr Aafia was jailed in Afghanistan. Talking about the grey lady prisoner of Bigram jail, she said in those times the US administration would dehumanise the prisoners and the same was done to Dr Aafia. She was wounded by the US soldiers and in injured condition she was brought to the US and tried by a court in a highly biased manner and jailed for long 86 years, which means the rest of her life. Zeina El-Debis, leader of the Friends of Aafia and founder of the Shade of Mercy Foundation, talked about their efforts to get Dr Aafia repatriated on humanitarian grounds. She said the documentary was also a part of such efforts. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2024 Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

This, of course, is a cliché. But it happens to be a cliché that is quite literally true. Here is why.\xa0 Pakistan’s ‘youth bulge’ is palpable. Just over two out of every three Pakistanis today are below the age of 30 and just under one in every three is between 15 and 29 years of age (our definition of youth). What the demographic momentum imbedded in this one statistic implies is that Pakistan is not just a young country, but that it is going to remain young till at least to 2050, possibly longer. \xa0More importantly, my own research suggests that the youth of Pakistan\xa0know\xa0this and they expect being given the attention and respect this demographic reality demands. Others who have looked at the question have come to similar conclusions. But the fact of the matter is that we do not need statistics to tell us that Pakistan is a young country. You just need to look around you. Any street. Any marketplace. Advertising on your television set. Certainly, on your Twitter feed. Any political\xa0jalsa [gathering]. Any office. Even elected officials and unelected political influentials. The generational change is not on its way. It’s here. It’s set. And, most importantly, it’s here to stay. At least for, and probably for more than, the next two decades. With the majority of Pakistan’s population below the age of 30, the young will invariably influence the country’s future trajectory. However, where the youth of today take this country will depend on the choices that today’s policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make. Eos presents an excerpt from an essay by Adil Najam from the book Pakistan: Search for Stability, published by Oxford University Press… BEING YOUNG IN PAKISTAN In 2017, the\xa0Pakistan Human Development Report\xa0produced a comprehensive profile of youth in Pakistan, including a wealth of empirical and opinion data on the young, collected from an estimated 130,000 Pakistanis. However, the key question that we, the authors of the report, were most concerned with was “what does it mean to be young in Pakistan?” Not surprisingly, no easy answers were forthcoming. Like so many other places in the world, being young in Pakistan is both exciting and frustrating. The space that the young occupy in Pakistani society is vast and full of possibilities but, in their own words, is often described as crumbling, contested and constrained on the one hand, and uneven, unfair and uncertain on the other. It is a space that is defined by high hopes, but also deep fears. As subsequent research and events have confirmed, to be young in Pakistan is to be highly agitated, and very often angry. Our research does begin pointing out some of the reasons why this is so. For example, if you were to computationally condense the over 60 million young Pakistanis aged between 15 and 29 into a statistically representative one hundred young people, you would find that just 30 of them consider themselves to be functionally literate, 29 would never have gone to school (despite all being 15 or above), only 6 would have 12 or more years of education and just 39 would be employed. More telling, however, are the structural depravations which highlight that the space ‘to be young’ is severely constrained and shrinking. Of the 100, only six would have access to a library, only seven to a sports facility, just 21 to a park. Only three would have ever been to a cinema, only three to a live music performance. Fifty-nine would say that they do not play sports, or only infrequently. One in the 100 would own a car, 12 a motorcycle, 10 a bicycle and 77 would have no means of personal mobility. Each of these depravations becomes even more acute for women, rural youth, and other marginalised groups within the young. And, yet, within this notional 100, we also found a spirit of great national pride, high aspirations, much hope, and tremendous expectations. They were eager to announce, to any who wish to ride the tiger of Pakistan’s youth, to never forget that this is a generation that demands and deserves better. They are politically excited, excitable and astute. While only 24 percent said (in 2016) that they trusted political leaders, 90 percent of young men and 55 percent of young women claimed that they would vote in the next elections. Of every 100, 48 believe that Pakistan’s future will be bright — although 36 fear it will be bleak. Most tellingly, 67 [of the 100] believe that their lives are and should be better than their parents, only 15 expect themselves to be worse-off than their parents; 89 say they feel happy; 70 say they feel safe. All of them demand the space and conditions in which they can achieve their aspirations. In short, the world of young Pakistanis is as diverse, as differentiated, and as divided as the rest of Pakistan. However, they also have greater expectations and aspirations which, if nurtured, could yield high dividends. Much more telling, however, is the palpable impatience and restlessness which, if ignored, could result in disaster. There are three things to keep in mind as we think about youth anywhere in the world, but certainly in the context of Pakistan. First, and most importantly, youth is\xa0a defining category. The reason to think of the young as a category is not just because they are so many, but because — even if they were not this many — the 15-29 year age bracket is where ‘citizenship’ matures. Second, youth is fleeting. Analytically, too, youth is a transitory and\xa0dynamic category. Because changes happen fast and furious when one is young, the definition of youth identity and what it stands for can change rapidly, even whilst within that category. Those turning 15 or 16 today can find themselves very distant from those turning 28 or 29 and will very likely not easily recognise the passions of those who would be 16 by the time they turn 28. This may well be true for other categories too but is consequential here, because the short window of this category and the rapid changes within it make notions of what “youth believe”, \xa0“youth stand for”, \xa0and “youth want”, or even ideas of the “youth vote”, are much more transitory and contestable than many analysts assume, and do compound the challenges of youth representation. Finally, youth — especially in Pakistan — is an extremely\xa0diverse category. At one level, any category of well over 60 million individuals cannot possibly be homogenous and would demand an investigation into its internal contradictions. But, much more than that, each of the major cleavages that exist in Pakistani society are compounded in its young: gender, class, rural-urban, wealth, technology, ethnicities, religiosity and sectarianism, and geography. PAKISTAN AND ITS YOUNG: THREE PROPOSITIONS Building and extending on the available research, let us review three key propositions — political, societal and developmental — on how the young of Pakistan might influence the future trajectories of the country’s society and politics. These propositions are offered not as predictions or scenarios, but as choice points. Embedded within each proposition are levers of possible change — where the youth of today take this country will very much depend on the choices that policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make on each of these dimensions. Proposition 1:\xa0The young of today are defining tomorrow’s politics, but not always in ways we imagine On the face of it, the bold sounds, sights, language, and even substance of Pakistan politics today seems driven by the young. Even where mainstream political parties are still led by septuagenarians, they wrap themselves in the emblems of youth; political rallies of all parties, even religious ones, feel like high-intensity concerts; political communication is not only geared towards the young but most often crafted by them. On the one hand, this is not entirely new, nor surprising. On the other, however, there is something palpably different, as if what would have been ‘regular’ youthfulness is now on steroids. There is significant reason to believe why it is, and will remain, so. At a basic demographic level, all political actors realise how the maths works: the young are the single largest bloc of new and impressionable voters in Pakistan and there is a long-term and steady supply of them. The demography described in the\xa0Pakistan National Human Development Report\xa0suggests that every election in Pakistan between now and around 2050 will be defined by the youth vote — including, of course, by their choice to vote or not. Notwithstanding the dichotomy of young Pakistanis claiming high intent to vote and a history of not having done so in the past, the number of young entrants into the voting mix means that, mostly within two election cycles, today’s new voter would be about to — or would already have — enter(ed) a burgeoning 30-49 years middle-age category historically the most reliable and loyal voting group in Pakistan. The political logic of investing in the young voter is impeccable. But demography alone does not explain the dominance of the youth voice in Pakistani politics today. Technology seems to have played an even more defining role; a role that is likely to be as enduring. That the rise of ‘new’ (especially social) media would trigger a steep decline of the ‘old’ (particularly print) media was probably inevitable, but the ‘control’ younger political operatives now exert over social media in all political groupings is remarkable and is now driving significant parts of the political narratives in the country. Of course, certain leaders and parties have capitalised more on courting the youth vote than others and have been differently successful in it. This matters, but mostly in ways that it has always mattered. One should not expect permanence in youth loyalties, not least because it remains a dynamic and diverse category.\xa0 It remains to be seen if the current and emerging youth bulge will practically change ballot box behaviour, but conditions are certainly ripe to create the possibility. Finally, a very remarkable feature of Pakistan’s emergent political discourse is how explicit mention of youth issues is nearly absent from political narratives. This, despite the feverish pitch of the political discourse, despite the active participation of the young in this discourse, and even despite the role the young are clearly playing in shaping the narratives. A possible explanation for this anomaly could be that politically active youth in Pakistan have convinced themselves that the pathway to material benefits for themselves — particularly, for example, in the area of employment and improved living conditions — lies through the choice of political leadership rather than of policy. Proposition 2:\xa0Give the young the ability to be young or expect a Pakistan tomorrow that is as divided as it is today The idea that we are denying the young in Pakistan the space to be young is a major finding of the\xa0Pakistan National Human Development Report. But it is a thought that first hit me like a ton of bricks in December 2014, as I visited the New Muslim College in Charsadda — just days after the horrific terrorist attack at the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar — to hold a focus group discussion with 15-18-year-olds on what young Pakistanis were thinking. It struck me that the young men with me in the room were not much older than the students who had died at APS just a few days ago, or those who had done the horrific killing. The reality of the APS attack hung heavy in the room and I realised, as did they, that it is the young in Pakistan who have had to do much of the dying in the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ But there was also a palpably steely resolve in the room. Here is what I wrote about that encounter: “Unlike every other APS conversation I had been hearing — on television, on social media, from politicians, in drawing rooms — theirs was devoid of sloganeering. There was no sign of despair. No hollow display of anger or anguish. No camouflaging of fear with bravado. Instead, there was resolve. Very endearing. Very becoming. Very mature. A very matter-of-fact recognition that this was the reality of the Pakistan they had inherited. A reality they now have to live with…” It is then that I fully realised the perils of being young in Pakistan. “Extremists are out to indoctrinate the young. Terrorists are out to kill them. Educational institutions can neither guarantee quality education nor physical security. An emergent politics of anger uses the passions of the young as fuel for petty politicking. The result is that the space for the young to be young has shrunk — is endangered.” My research has convinced me that the best gift that Pakistan can give to its young is to return to them the ability to be young. Indeed, it may be the best gift Pakistan can give itself — a future where this ability continues to be denied cannot be good for any Pakistani. Being young is not just about being carefree, it is also about being able to explore. In the shrinking space to be able to do so, the young in Pakistan have already inherited most of the societal divides that define the country as a whole. That as many young Pakistanis consider being a Pakistani as their primary identity as consider their religion to be their primary identity, is probably reflective of society as a whole. But what was the most disturbing aspect of our research was that more than 40 percent young men and 50 percent young women disapproved of having friendly relations with someone from another religion, or even another sect; nearly three out of every four young Pakistanis (men and women) responded that they would disapprove of someone from a different religion or sect preaching their religion. The distrust that defines Pakistani society as a whole is equally prevalent amongst the young.\xa0 Just over 20 percent said they trusted politicians, only around 25 percent trust the police, just 40 percent had trust in the judiciary and less than 50 percent in the media. All of this was in 2016, and there is enough reason to believe that trust amongst the young has only eroded further since then. Such a snapshot should be read not just as what the youth of today think, but what the Pakistan of tomorrow is likely to think. The challenges of social division, societal distrust and mutual intolerance are clearly great, but solutions are available. Silly as it may sound to some, given the enormity of the challenges, the very first — and possibly most meaningful, although not always easy — step should be resolute policy in allowing the young to be young. Sports grounds are not a big investment, but they can be more meaningful than we might think. It is remarkable how parochial we have become, and simple steps to enhance mobility for the young, including the ability for travel exchange within the country to get to meet other Pakistanis who may not look like us but are equally Pakistanis, is another small but possibly impactful investment. Safe and affordable mobility (along with reliable childcare and clean bathrooms) for young women, in fact, emerges as amongst the most effective means of significantly increasing women’s participation in the workforce. Obvious as it should be by now, it is worth noting that, as we think about youth as a category for social analysis, now and into the future, the simple dichotomy of ‘young vs old’ is not only un-useful but can also be dangerous. In society, as in politics, some of the greatest and most alienating divisions that exist in Pakistan exist amongst the young themselves. The policy challenge is to find ways to reduce these divisions now before they sink deep roots and are passed on to the future, and to future generations. The goal is not empty slogans of ‘integration’, but investing in practical means for the young in Pakistan to interact with other young people in Pakistan. Across divisions of gender, class, geography, religion and rural-urban-metropolitan, the bridges that need to be built are not just of concrete but of conversation. Proposition 3: ‘Boom or bust?’ — it’s a choice We began the\xa02017 Pakistan National Human Development Report\xa0with a story that is not from Pakistan. It remains valid and is worth repeating here: “On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in a small town in Tunisia set himself on fire, following a confrontation with a municipal official about where his cart was parked. While the specifics of what led to Mohamed Bouazizi’s death are unclear, what is indisputable is his fatal self-immolation catalysed protests that toppled Tunisia’s dictator and led to a string of uprisings in the region that came to be called the Arab Spring. “The aim of mentioning this situation here is not to recount what happened in Tunis that day, or in the other countries of the Arab Spring subsequently. [Our concern is] with Pakistan’s youth. So, fast forward to Pakistan. “Can you imagine a situation, anywhere in Pakistan, where a young person feels so frustrated by unemployment, or so disheartened, un-empowered and marginalised, that he takes a measure as extreme as Bouazizi did in Tunisia? One certainly hopes not. But hope alone is not enough. It is the responsibility of the state as well as society to enable an environment for our youth where such a fate is not even imaginable. Not even in our worst nightmares.” Trying to predict whether Pakistan’s demographic youth momentum will end up being a ‘boom’ or a ‘bust’ is a fool’s errand. That Pakistan today has the largest number of young people it has ever had and that this number is set to grow over the next multiple decades, is a fact. How this fact will play out is not a matter of reading tea leaves, it is a matter of policy choice. There is the inherent potential of a ‘boom’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new young entrants into the economy can become motors of consumption, generators of ideas and innovation and harbingers of new social energy. There is also the equally inherent potential of a ‘bust’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new entrants into the economy need new employment, can feel suffocated by the lack of room to grow, and can burn with anger when existing systems they wish for are not enabled to change. Certainly not as simple as it may sound, but the final path taken does depend on the choices made by policy, by society, and by the young themselves.

The satellite, part of China’s Chang’e-6 lunar mission, was launched from the Hainan province on May 3 and had successfully entered the moon’s orbit at 1:14pm on May 8. The moon is at an average distance of 384,400km from earth. The lunar module was designed by Islamabad’s Institute of Space Technology (IST) in collaboration with China’s Shanghai University (SJTU) and Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco. The landmark images were unveiled at a ceremony organised at the China National Space Agency (CNSA) to mark the successful mission accomplishment, IST spokesperson and head of Department of Electrical and Computer Science, Dr Khurram Khursheed told Dawn.com. They were officially handed over to Pakistan’s ambassador to Beijing, she added. View this post on Instagram One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis\xadtan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the moon and the sun. —  Suparco/CNSA The iCube-Q orbiter carries two optical cameras to image the lunar surface. The module is a cube satellite or cubesat — miniature satellites typically characterised by their small size and standardized cubic design. Due to their compact size and relatively low cost compared to traditional satellites, CubeSats offered opportunities for universities, research institutions and commercial entities to participate in space missions and gather valuable data for scientific advancement and innovation. Operating in extreme temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius, the satellite features a 7-kilogramme one-megapixel camera tailored for missions with power constraints. Dr Khursheed had said the satellite would play a critical role in deep space missions. “Its surface-level analysis capabilities, transmitting images at a modest 1-kbps, will provide crucial data on crater locations, water, and traces of ice on the moon’s surface,” he had said. As the Chinese lander collects rock and soil samples, iCube-Q will spend three to six months orbiting the moon, capturing and transmitting images of the moon back to Earth. The IST said the opportunity to release the cubesat in lunar orbit from the Chang’e-6 mission was offered by the CNSA through the Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (Apsco). After a thorough evaluation, Pakistan’s proposal was accepted out of all Apsco member states. One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis\xadtan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the sun shining brightly. —  Suparco/CNSA The Chang’e-6 mission, which aims to explore the moon’s “dark side”, employs lunar research payloads from multiple countries, including Pakistan’s iCube-Qamar satellite. The mission is named after the mythical Chinese moon goddess. Nasa is banned by US law from any collaboration, direct or indirect, with China. On Chang’e-6, China is carrying payloads from France, Italy, Sweden and Pakistan, while Chang’e-7 will bear payloads from Russia, Switzerland and Thailand when it launches in 2026. Chang’e-6 aims to collect around 2kg of lunar samples from the far side of the Moon and bring them back to Earth for analysis. Chinese state news agency Xinhua had hailed it as “the first endeavour of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration”. China will send a robotic spacecraft in the coming days on a round trip to the moon’s far side in the first of three technically demanding missions that will pave the way for an inaugural Chinese crewed landing and a base on the lunar south pole. The probe is set to land in the immense South Pole-Aitken Basin, one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system. Once there, it will scoop up lunar soil and rocks, and carry out other experiments in the landing zone. With no direct line of sight with the Earth, Chang’e-6 must rely on a recently deployed relay satellite orbiting the moon during its 53-day mission, including a never-before-attempted ascent from the moon’s “hidden” side on its return journey home.

Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

In a post on social media site X, a military spokesperson also called on residents and displaced people in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, and 11 other neighbourhoods in the enclave to go immediately to places west of Gaza City. The Palestinian health ministry said at least 37 Palestinians, 24 of them from central Gaza areas, were killed in overnight airstrikes across the enclave, including in Rafah. “They threw fliers on Rafah and said, from Rafah to al-Zawayda is safe, people should evacuate there, and they did, and what has become of them? Dismembered bodies? There is no safe place in Gaza,” Khitam Al-Khatib, who said she had lost at least 10 of her relatives in an airstrike on a family house earlier on Saturday, told Reuters. Al-Zawayda is a small town in central Gaza Strip that has been crowded by thousands of displaced people from across the enclave. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck tens of targets across the Strip over the past day, adding its ground troops had eliminated fighters in Zeitoun in recent hours. An Israeli airstrike killed at least seven people in a house in Beit Lahiya town in the northern Gaza Strip, all from the same family, medics said. In Rafah, residents said the new evacuation orders by the Israeli military covered areas in the centre of the city and left little doubt Israel planned to expand its ground offensive there. “The situation is very difficult, people are leaving their homes in panic,” said Khaled, 35, a resident of the Shaboura neighbourhood, an area where the new orders to leave have been issued. The Israeli military said it was continuing operational activity against Hamas fighters in eastern Rafah and on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing. Despite heavy US pressure and alarm expressed by residents and humanitarian groups, Israel has said it will proceed with an incursion into Rafah, where more than one million displaced people have sought refuge during the seven-month-old war. Israeli tanks captured the main road dividing Rafah’s eastern and western sections on Friday, effectively encircling the eastern side in an assault that has caused Washington to hold up the delivery of some military aid to its ally. Two crossing points vital for delivery of aid to Gaza were still closed on Saturday. The Palestinian WAFA news agency said the Rafah crossing was closed for a fifth day, while another crossing, Kerem Shalom, has been shut for around a week. The latest evacuation orders came hours after internationally mediated ceasefire talks appeared to be faltering, with Hamas saying Israel’s rejection of the truce offer it had accepted returned things to square one. The Palestinian militant group also hinted it was reconsidering its negotiation policy. It did not elaborate on whether a review meant it would harden its terms for reaching a deal but said it would consult with other allied factions. In Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands were sheltering, Palestinians mourned relatives during funerals on Saturday. “Here they are, in pieces, here is my sister-in-law, without a head, my aunt is without a head, what is this injustice? Until when will this go on? We are exhausted, by God we are exhausted, I have lived in tents for the past seven months,” said Khatib, sitting near bodies wrapped in white shrouds bearing the names of the dead men and women. Egypt refuses to coordinate Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the entry of aid into Gaza from the Rafah crossing due to Israel’s “unacceptable escalation”, Egypt’s state-affiliated Alqahera News satellite TV reported on Saturday, citing a senior official. The official also said that Egypt held Israel responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the Gaza Strip.

In a recent interview to SAMAA TV, he emphasised the urgent need for men to take the lead in condemning and criminalising harassment in all its forms. He also took pride in belonging to a family that boasts accomplished women. “I’m very proud of them and grateful. It’s a fact that when women in your family are independent and powerful, they can support you and become your strength. But it is unfortunate that even today, women have to face harassment in all professional fields, whether it’s the corporate [world] or the showbiz.” The Pyarey Afzal and Alif actor added that the onus of fostering a safe and supportive environment for women lies on men because they’re the ones to blame for perpetuating a culture of silence and complicity. Calling for greater solidarity from men and emphasising the importance of creating inclusive environments where women can thrive professionally, Abbasi said, “We [men] should play a leading role in this situation. “We have to make sure that wherever we see harassment, we don’t accept it. We demonise it. We don’t encourage or normalise it. Because unfortunately, we, men, have normalised and celebrated such behaviour. We didn’t scrutinise it the way it should have been scrutinised. So we need to call out and criminalise such behaviour in our circles,” he added. Abbasi commended women who have spoken up against harassment and encouraged dialogue around the issue. “It gives me great optimism that in today’s day and age, women are very forthcoming and are calling out harassment, whether it’s online or at the workplace. The times when women would face harassment and stay mum about it are thankfully behind us.” The Legend of Maula Jatt star emphasised the need to encourage such behaviour among women. “The culture of speaking up also needs to be encouraged. Women should be able to make noise wherever they are if ever they face harassment of any kind. Without any fear or hesitation, women should be encouraged to raise hell. We need to eradicate the element of fear and shame among women.” By speaking out against harassment, Abbasi sends a powerful message to men everywhere — it is incumbent upon us to stand up, speak out, and actively work towards creating a world where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.

One can’t help but wonder how entering into a marriage contract at a tender age warrants this title. Visibly upset, Seema recounted her story, explaining why she received the honour. Married at the tender age of 13 and diagnosed with vaginal fistula when she was 16 years old, Seema’s existence has since become synonymous with agony. Every villager, out of pity for her deteriorating health, would visit her, oblivious to the struggle she bore in silence. With no funds for treatment, her father-in-law had even asked the doctor to give her poison — a desperate plea for relief. Before delving further into Seema’s story, it is important to understand what vaginal fistula is. The condition occurs when an abnormal passage is created between the vagina and neighbouring pelvic organs like the bladder or rectum. This can lead to numerous complications, including urinary and faecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections, and various other symptoms. Doctors warn that untreated fistulas can escalate to reproductive system cancers, potentially even leading to death. Seema described the pain to be so agonising that she wished for a quick death on several occasions. It’s a stark contrast to the dreams that typically fill the heart of a 16-year-old girl — dreams of a future adorned with aspirations and possibilities. However, Seema found herself teetering on the precipice of despair, grappling with the grim reality of her life-long disease. It only makes sense for her to be called the ‘Woman of the Year,’ doesn’t it? Her journey isn’t merely reflective of the far-reaching consequences of fistula but is also a testament to the devastating consequences of child marriage. According to a Unicef report an estimated 18 per cent of young girls are wed before reaching adulthood [18 years of age], amounting to almost 19 million child brides in the country. The number of unreported instances is believed to be even higher. As per the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC), Pakistan has the sixth highest number of women married before the age of 18 in the world. The adverse impacts of early marriage are manifold, encompassing the deteriorating health of the young bride, high-risk pregnancy, and impediments to both her education and personal growth. Moreover, in developing countries such as Pakistan, the unregulated cycle of childbirth places a heavy financial strain on parents, as they struggle to support multiple children, ultimately perpetuating poverty within these families. Despite tireless global campaigns and legal enforcement in these countries, the insidious practice of child marriage persists. This prevalence is fuelled by a glaring lack of awareness regarding the severe repercussions of such unions, amplifying the issue. The plight of girls under 18 is particularly dire, as depicted in Seema’s case. Her story serves as a stark reminder of the health complications faced by these young brides face. From debilitating conditions like fistula to a myriad of other ailments, many women are condemned to a lifetime of anguish. While some manage to recover through treatment, others suffer without ever experiencing improvement in their health. Dr Sajjad Ahmed, who offers free treatment to patients at Koohi Goth Hospital in Karachi, said that a significant number of women travel long distances from remote areas to seek treatment at the hospital located in the port city’s Bin Qasim Town. This reality underscores the inadequacy of basic facilities accessible to women in Pakistan. At the other end of the country, Dr Sher Shah and his dedicated team annually organise medical camps in Gilgit, offering treatment and performing surgeries for fistula patients free of cost. While minor cases receive care at City Hospital Gilgit, those requiring more intensive procedures are referred to Koohi Goth Hospital in Karachi. Dr Sher Shah mentioned how the hospital serves patients not only from across the country but also extends care to individuals from Afghanistan, Iran, Sharjah, and Yemen. Drawing patients from the farthest corners of Sindh, Punjab, Chitral, and Gilgit-Baltistan, including the remote locales of Skardu, Diamir, and Ghizar, individuals recover under their expertise. The hospital has provided free surgeries to almost 40 patients from Gilgit-Baltistan alone. Despite the invaluable services rendered, the absence of more specialised hospitals for the condition remains a gap in the country’s healthcare infrastructure, he added. Dr Nazneen Zamir Farooqi, a gynaecologist at City Hospital Gilgit, gets patients from remote areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, including Diamer, Astor, Skardu, Kharmang, Darel, and Ghizar. In many of these regions, the scarcity of healthcare facilities and the absence of skilled attendants during childbirth worsen the problem. “The pervasive practice of child marriage significantly contributes to this crisis. When young girls are married off, their bodies are ill-equipped for childbirth — a biological reality — as physical maturity is typically achieved post-puberty,” she explained. Consequently, girls under 18 years face heightened risks of complications, and if they contract fistula, their suffering is only magnified. Throughout pregnancy and childbirth, the absence of adequate treatment can result in a spectrum of deformities in women’s bodies, often leading to the onset of debilitating diseases. Among these, fistula stands out as one of the most distressing, inflicting not only physical discomfort but also profound psychological and social ramifications. Girls married off at a young age have underdeveloped bodies and fragile bones. If they undergo childbirth before their bodies have fully matured, they are at risk of developing fistula. Similarly, older women who have borne numerous children may experience weakened muscles, rendering them incapable of delivering the baby during childbirth. In some cases, it may also lead them to develop this condition. In both scenarios, giving birth to a child becomes an excruciating process for the woman, wherein the pressure exerted by the baby’s head against the muscles between the bladder and the vagina may result in the formation of a fistula. In many cases, the babies are stillborn. Without immediate medical intervention, the affected woman is condemned to endure the pain. The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, a federal law in Pakistan in alignment with international conventions on children’s rights, unequivocally condemns a marriage involving a girl under 16 years of age and a boy under 18 years of age as a violation of fundamental rights. Although each province in Pakistan has established its own regulations, in the absence of specific provincial guidelines, national law takes precedence. Any breach of this law carries severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to six months and fines reaching up to Rs50,000, meant to serve as a deterrent against such grave infringements. As per the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) conducted in 2016-17, the prevalence of child marriages in Gilgit-Baltistan, especially in areas such as Chilas, Darel, Tangir, and Kharmang, stands alarmingly high, soaring to approximately 26pc. Despite concerted efforts to tackle the issue, including the introduction of legislation in 2015, progress has been hindered by opposition within the legislative assembly, leading to delays in its enactment. While the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 is in place, its enforcement in these regions falls well short of the mark. And without a legal mandate imposing age restrictions, many see no obligation to adhere to the law. Subsequently, the absence of robust legislation and effective enforcement mechanisms perpetuates the cycle of child marriages, leaving the issue entirely unresolved. Child marriage is not merely a tradition; it has a direct bearing on human health and development. While marriage may bring a sense of satisfaction for many, it also entails significant responsibilities, demanding mental, physical, and financial preparedness. Experts argue that minors lack the maturity essential for a thriving marriage, posing potential health risks. We cannot afford the luxury of complacency while the innocence of our children is sacrificed at the altar of an archaic practice. It falls upon each of us, as guardians of our collective conscience, to demand comprehensive legislation that will dismantle the structures perpetuating child marriages. For the sake of our daughters and sons, for the preservation of their health, dignity, and dreams, we must act decisively. The time for rhetoric has passed; it is now time for action.

The study is set to redefine such carriers as having a ‘new genetic form’ of the mind-wasting disease. The reclassification may change the current norms surrounding Alzheimer’s research, diagnosis and approaches to treatment, according to the researchers. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine. “Through the data, we are saying that perhaps this is a genetic form of this disease, not merely a risk factor indication” the co-author of the study, Sterling Johnson, from the University of Wisconsin’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center told reporters at a press briefing. Scientists have known for three decades that individuals with two copies of APOE4 gene variant, have a significantly higher risk of developing the disease, as compared to individuals with the most common version of the APOE gene, known as APOE3. About 2 to 3 per cent of the general population, or about 15 per cent of people with Alzheimer’s, have two copies of the APOE4 variant. “This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer’s if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer’s earlier than people without this gene,” stated professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Edinburgh (Tara was not involved in the study). Dr. Juan Fortea and his colleagues, from the University of Barcelona conducted an in-depth study of more than 3,000 brains donated from the US National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Centre. They also delved into biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from five datasets in three countries. They found that by the age of 65, at least 95pc of people with two copies of APOE4, known as ‘homozygotes’, had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer’s-related protein termed ‘beta amyloid’ in their spinal fluid, while 75pc had positive brain scans for amyloid. Nearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at the age of 65 than people who were not carrying the risk variant. The findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three fundamental criteria for being a genetic disease. Firstly, almost all individuals with these two gene variants have Alzheimer’s biology, they all develop symptoms at about the same rate and clinical and biological changes occur in a sequence that may be predicted, the researchers stated. A Professor of the UCL Genetics Institute, namely David Curtis (who was not involved in the research), remained unconvinced of the findings. “I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some ‘distinct genetic form’ of Alzheimer’s disease’,” he said in a statement. “No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer’s disease” he said. The findings could have broader implications for the recently approved Alzheimer’s treatment ‘Leqembi’ by Eisai and Biogen. This a drug that reportedly removes amyloid from the brain. In clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant depicted much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. In view of this, some centres shy away from treating these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, who worked on the study, stated at the press briefing.

National Foods has invested Rs7 billion to establish its largest state-of-the-art production plant in Faisalabad, and International Packaging Films, a subsidiary of International Packaging Films Ltd (IPAK), has enhanced its flexible packaging film production capacity in Lahore, bringing its total investment in its three manufacturing facilities to Rs13.5bn. Moreover, both companies plan to vigorously explore export markets for their products. “We plan to export $15-20 million worth of flexible packaging films this year, which is roughly 20 per cent of our total production capacity of 152,000 tonnes,” IPAK CEO Naveed Godil says. Food packaging is an important growth driver, enabling consumers to look for different options and compare the value offerings before making a purchase. “Packaging also helps enhance the portability of products, preserves taste, and increases shelf life,” he notes, adding that his company holds a 38pc flexible film packaging market share in the country. ‘The total local market size is Rs80-100bn, and we expect an annual growth of 7-8pc in flexible packaging films by food companies in the country’ Pakistan’s demand for flexible packaging films is approximately 200,000 tonnes against a total production capacity of 300,000 tonnes, leaving a surplus of 100,000 tonnes for export. The company’s revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 41pc in the last three years. The rapid growth in its revenues, fueled by enhanced production capacity, has encouraged the company to conduct book building on May 8-9 for its Initial Public Offering (IPO) through the sale of 70.1m shares, representing 10pc of its post-IPO capital, in a new stock issuance. A quarter of the shares being offered on the market will be sold to retail investors. The IPO — the 14th in the last five years — will help it raise Rs1.47bn at a floor price of Rs21 per share to partly repay its long-term debt of Rs4bn acquired in recent years for capacity expansion. Mr Godil explained, “The total local market size is Rs80-100bn, depending on the dollar value, and we expect an annual growth of 7-8pc in the usage of flexible packaging films by food companies in the country. We want to work on a complete import substitution by helping and supporting the downstream industry in Pakistan, which can easily be produced locally, saving around $25m annually.” The company offers a diverse portfolio of packaging solutions, producing Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene, Cast Polypropylene, and Biaxially Oriented Poly-Ethylene Terephthalate films. It is the first group in Pakistan to provide one-window flexible packaging solutions. According to him, the flexible film packaging industry in general, and his company in particular, are working extensively to encourage investment in recycling flexible packaging films. Likewise, National Foods’ new manufacturing facility, part of the company’s plan to reduce the nation’s reliance on imported raw materials through its ‘Seed To Table’ initiative launched in partnership with progressive farm-managing companies, will help it cater to the domestic market, significantly increase its export volume, and create over 600 jobs. “We have launched our ‘Seed to Table’ initiative to reduce the country’s dependency on imported raw materials, particularly the annual import of tomato paste amounting to $10m.” He says the tomato project results have exceeded his expectations, and his company intends to double the acreage to 1,000 acres next year. He says the same model will now be replicated with other key ingredients like red chillies, further strengthening domestic agriculture and reducing reliance on imports. Pakistan produces approximately 144,000 tonnes of red chillies annually, yet over 20,000 tonnes have to be imported per year to meet specific industry requirements. “The new production facility is equipped with cutting-edge technology and production capacity of 6000 tonnes/month for production of spices, recipe mixes, ketchup, mayonnaise, Chinese sauces, seasonings and Kasuri Methi,” the company’s global CEO Abrar Hasan told this correspondent at the Pakistan Agriculture Connection Expo & Conference in Lahore. Currently, the food company exports its products to 40 countries across five continents. It has subsidiaries in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and North America and has recently expanded its supply chain to Canada. Regarding hurdles in increasing processed food exports, Abrar Hasan notes that Pakistani companies could not expand their presence in the international export markets because of various issues, including restrictions on their investments abroad. “Our dilemma is the same one that is being faced by the country: the dollar crunch. Companies must invest abroad to ensure their presence in foreign markets and boost their exports. But the State Bank doesn’t allow you to invest abroad because we do not have dollars for that. “Strangely enough, individuals have greater and freer access to foreign exchange than the corporates. The exporters are allowed to retain 10pc and invest 10pc of their export revenues, and this facility is available only to the existing exporters for setting up their shop outside the country. “This amount is not enough to make your presence felt in the foreign markets. This also means that a new investor who wants to venture into the export market cannot do so because they don’t have foreign exchange,” he says. He believes that the country’s exports cannot increase unless foreign exchange is freely available to companies. “We export our products through distributors sitting in foreign markets. But this model isn’t very successful. If we want to boost our exports and display our products on large supermarkets’ shelves, we need fulfilment centres and warehouses in those markets,” Hasan argues. According to him, the effort to raise exports requires companies like this to invest in raw material supply and the forward distribution chain in foreign markets. “That is the only way of guaranteeing the quality of products according to international standards and ensuring a continuous, uninterrupted supply to the international buyers,” he urges.

According to meteorological forecasts, the precipitation in the Anhui region during this summer is expected to increase by 50 to 80 percent compared to the usual levels. The possible extreme rainfall-induced floods pose a great threat to the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute is utilizing digital tools and other technical expertise to carry out flood prevention and the maintenance of power grid equipment. On Thursday, at the inspection site of the Yungu 220 KV transformer substation in Hefei, Anhui province, maintenance personnel inspected goods and materials regarding flood prevention and uploaded related information. Technical staff members from the institute conducted statistical analysis of all units through the Anhui power grid disaster prevention platform. Those efforts provided robust support for power grid flood prevention. Power grid flood warning and prediction is a data-intensive task, and the institute is actively advancing the collection and integration of data in need. By gathering data from various sources such as the number forecast center, hydrological bureaus and meteorological departments, an intelligent algorithm system for warning of floods and geological disasters is being constructed. Through the use of data and positioning systems, disaster warnings of particular stations or lines can be achieved. Real-time risk prediction can be sent to front lines through the platform to help initiate flood prevention emergency responses, organize patrols and ensure timely access to flood information. Based on the inspection operation app, maintenance personnel can conduct inspections of low-lying substations, ground wire station buildings, foundational waterlogged poles or towers and other power grid facilities. All flood prevention risk information can be found at the disaster prevention platform. Utilizing digital methods to monitor and control the progress of risk management, they have achieved a full-process control from risk identification, to formulation of risk management plans and finally to the elimination of the risks. Additionally, based on the distribution of risks, a refined scheduling of flood prevention can be organized. Combining historical data on floods, flood-prone areas, and other relevant information, technical personnel from the institute utilized the disaster prevention platform to analyze high-risk power grid equipment in flood-prone areas. Innovative technologies such as three-eye cameras, videos and the precise monitoring of water levels within stations were employed to accurately monitor water levels. Furthermore, drone inspections and shared tower videos were utilized to achieve precise disaster monitoring across all areas at all time. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute, in line with the requirements of digital transformation in power grid flood prevention, has established a digital control system for power grid flood prevention processes. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by power grid flood prevention work in areas such as prediction, material transportation and on-site inspections during flood seasons.

The world body approved the Arab and Palestinian-sponsored resolution by a vote of 143-9 with 25 abstentions. It is Israel\'s relentless military offensive in Gaza since Oct 7 that has prompted more UN members to join the pro-Palestine group. A UN General Assembly resolution on Oct 27 calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza was approved 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Although the US can still veto Palestine\'s UN membership in the UN Security Council voting on the issue as it did on April 18, the result of the latest UN General Assembly vote reflects a wider support for full membership of Palestine in the UN, which means a greater pressure on Washington to act against the will of the world. US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood said on Friday that for the US to support Palestinian statehood, direct negotiations must guarantee Israel\'s security and future as a democratic Jewish state and that Palestinians can live in peace in a state of their own. But by saying that the US side just pretends to be blind to the fact that it is the Israeli side that has been recklessly killing the Palestinian people on their land. And even if the Hamas Oct 7 attack is taken into account, what the Israel has done in the region since the World War II must also be borne in mind as well, which clearly shows the right and wrong regarding the Palestinian question. The world can see clearly that the statehood of Israel has not only been fully guaranteed but also the country has prospered. In the process, it has continuously expanded its influences to the Palestinian side beyond the 1967 borders, and even invaded neighboring countries, including Syria and Lebanon. Over the years, Israel, as the occupying power, has technically eroded the foundation of the two-state solution. The current conflict, which has lasted for more than seven months, is more likely to completely ruin the prospects of the two-state solution agreed by the international community. So it is not the security or future of Israeli people that has become a question of grave concern, but that of the Palestinians, whose survival in Gaza has even become a question today thanks to Israel\'s aggression indulged and supported by Washington, not to mention the overdue statehood of their country. That Israel intensified its attack on Rafah on Saturday, under the US\' acquiescence, in response to the UN General Assembly the Palestine-related vote the previous day, presents a grave provocation to the common will of the international community, and also serves to put an end to its peace talks with Hamas in Cairo that has lasted for days, in which Hamas had made big concessions for a ceasefire. Israel should stop its collective punishment of the Gaza people, stop advancing its military offensive in Rafah, and effectively remove all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. In the West Bank, Israel should stop all settlement activities and effectively curb the intensifying settler violence. Palestine should enjoy the same status as Israel, and the Palestinian people should enjoy the same rights as the Israeli people. It is the common responsibility of the international community, including the US, to support and promote the process of Palestinian independent statehood and provide a strong guarantee for the implementation of the two-state solution and the realization of lasting peace in the Middle East. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the US should put aside its own interests and work for world peace and humanity, undertaking its global responsibility. The UN Security Council is a platform to resolve issues and not create divisions or hijack the global peace agenda for one\'s own narrow ends by abusing its veto power. Copyright 1995 -  .

According to meteorological forecasts, the precipitation in the Anhui region during this summer is expected to increase by 50 to 80 percent compared to the usual levels. The possible extreme rainfall-induced floods pose a great threat to the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute is utilizing digital tools and other technical expertise to carry out flood prevention and the maintenance of power grid equipment. On Thursday, at the inspection site of the Yungu 220 KV transformer substation in Hefei, Anhui province, maintenance personnel inspected goods and materials regarding flood prevention and uploaded related information. Technical staff members from the institute conducted statistical analysis of all units through the Anhui power grid disaster prevention platform. Those efforts provided robust support for power grid flood prevention. Power grid flood warning and prediction is a data-intensive task, and the institute is actively advancing the collection and integration of data in need. By gathering data from various sources such as the number forecast center, hydrological bureaus and meteorological departments, an intelligent algorithm system for warning of floods and geological disasters is being constructed. Through the use of data and positioning systems, disaster warnings of particular stations or lines can be achieved. Real-time risk prediction can be sent to front lines through the platform to help initiate flood prevention emergency responses, organize patrols and ensure timely access to flood information. Based on the inspection operation app, maintenance personnel can conduct inspections of low-lying substations, ground wire station buildings, foundational waterlogged poles or towers and other power grid facilities. All flood prevention risk information can be found at the disaster prevention platform. Utilizing digital methods to monitor and control the progress of risk management, they have achieved a full-process control from risk identification, to formulation of risk management plans and finally to the elimination of the risks. Additionally, based on the distribution of risks, a refined scheduling of flood prevention can be organized. Combining historical data on floods, flood-prone areas, and other relevant information, technical personnel from the institute utilized the disaster prevention platform to analyze high-risk power grid equipment in flood-prone areas. Innovative technologies such as three-eye cameras, videos and the precise monitoring of water levels within stations were employed to accurately monitor water levels. Furthermore, drone inspections and shared tower videos were utilized to achieve precise disaster monitoring across all areas at all time. The State Grid Anhui Electric Power Research Institute, in line with the requirements of digital transformation in power grid flood prevention, has established a digital control system for power grid flood prevention processes. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by power grid flood prevention work in areas such as prediction, material transportation and on-site inspections during flood seasons. It enhanced the prediction and warning capabilities, promoted the usage of digital tools, and supports the digital transformation of the company. Copyright 1995 -  . All rights reserved.
